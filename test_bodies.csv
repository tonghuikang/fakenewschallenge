0,"The head of business development for Asia’s online technology media company, Techlist, revealed that the number of venture capital deals has stagnated in Singapore, during an annual Singapore conference yesterday.
Jason Lin was one of the over 20 featured speakers who comprises of CEOs and E-commence experts from all over the world. He said that Singapore may still be the top country for technology startups in South East Asia, but other SEA countries are catching up fast.

According to Techlist data, Indonesia and Malaysia see venture capital deals doubled up within just a quarter. The number of venture capital deals in Singapore has instead stagnated at 39. The number of E-commence startups in Indonesia is nearly twice that of Singapore.
With the rapid increase in infrastructural investments in the SEA region, more people will have internet access to form a bigger E-commence market. Other SEA markets are expected to surpass Singapore’s market which is perceived as concentrated considering how tech savvy the average Singaporean is.
Do you think it is only a matter of time Singapore loses it edge to its neighbours in South East Asia?

The Health Science Authority (HSA) of Singapore has issued a late health warning advisory on an online slimming pill brand, beFIT Total Garcinia Cambogia, declaring the weight-loss supplement dangerous and members of the public to not purchase these pills.
In a press release today, the HSA said they found traces of two potent and undeclared ingredients – sibutramine and phenolphthalein in the slimming pills.
“Sibutramine, a prescription only weight loss drug, has been banned in Singapore since 2010 due to serious safety concerns. Furthermore, the very high level of sibutramine detected in ‘beFIT Total Garcinia Cambogia’ could increase the toxicity of this product and lead to serious cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and fits. Changes in mood such as anxiety, depression and mood swings have also been reported.” – Health Science Authority of Singapore
The slimming pill brand’s Facebook page stated that the company is based in Seremban, Malaysia. Most reviews gave the slimming pills five stars ratings and the reviewers are all from Malaysia.
Distribution and sales of beFIT Total Garcinia Cambogia in Singapore is illegal, and one re-seller of the product is currently under police investigations. The unnamed re-seller may be facing two charges, one under the Poisons Act that carries a maximum fine up to $10,000 and jail term up to two years, and one under the Medicines Act that carries a maximum fine up to $5,000 and jail term up to two years.
Anyone who has come across a seller in Singapore may contact the HSA Enforcement Branch at 6866-3485 or email: [email protected]

2,"A 24 year old Malaysian was charged in court yeseterday (6th May) for posing as HDB officers to cheat elderly into giving him cash for repair works. Lee Zhen Ning came into Singapore on a visitor visa and his modus operandi is to pretend to be a HDB officer and con people in different HDB precincts to give him deposits for HDB repair works.
All of his three victims were elderly aged from 62 to 80 years old, who gave him differing amount from $20 to $300 as deposits.
Photo from HDB
Deputy Public Prosecutor Eunice Lim claimed that Lee Zhen Ning is a member of a Singapore-Malaysia cheating syndicate, but did not mention which organization he is with. Lee Zhen Ning face a maximum 10 years jail term and fines if convicted.
Many elderly in Singapore are very trusting of the government authority and they live in an era where government officials can act without official documents, which makes them easy targets for cheats today. Just last month this year, the Parliament passed a new law allowing HDB officers to enter HDB flats for urgent repairs. The Ministry of State for National Development Desmond Lee claimed that this act is necessary because some HDB owners “endanger themselves and their neighbour because of ignorance or carelessness” and intervention from the HDB is required. The government claimed that HDB will use the power “sparingly” and only as “a last resort”.
With the increase in HDB powers, it is likely to have more cheating cases happening in the heartland. However, homeowners living in condominiums and private properties are excluded from the new law that allows a government official to enter a flat without a warrant.
Do you think there will be lesser cheating cases if the HDB is not granted such powers?

3,"On 17th March, my vehicle was hit at the back by a Malaysian registered vehicle JQC6308 and the rear bumper of my vehicle was damaged. The driver Mr Mohd Alif Danial Wong Bin Abdulllah acknowleged that he is liability for the repair damages for my car, was said that he will bear the repair cost. But he has no money now and wait til end of March to his pay day. I agreed.
End of Mar, he off his phone and I was not able to contact him. On 5th April, I finally got him and he said he again had no money. I then told him it is fine I will claim against his insurance. I was supposed to claim within 30 days of accident. He asked me to give him a chance and that he will pay up end of April. I hesitated as end April will be more than 30 days since accident and thus I will not be able to claim. He promised that he will pay and I took his word for it
Today is 2nd May, and I had been taken for a ride by him again. Mr Mohd Alif Danial Wong Bin Abdulllah off his phone and refused to answer to my sms.
Reader submission
It seems that I have to bear the cost of the repair from an accident no fault of mine. It is a SHAME that foreign registered vehicle get away with this.
Hopefully this serves a reminder to Singaporean drivers not to be soft hearted and to claim on the vehicle with 30 days of accident.

4,"My niece, 19 was reading it, my friend in his early 20s was reading. According to my niece, TRS was the most popular sites among the younger generation.
Why the government fear this youthful energy? During 50s bus riots, it was the students. Thailand, it was the youth, Burma it was the youth, Egypt, it was the the younger generations. The knew this youthful energy, in order to counteract this energy, National Service was introduced.

Like an obedient dog schools and circus, they were whipped to be pliant. Sadly, this energy, the brave energy even sap the entrepreneurial spirits. Look at the hand phone service industry, a lucrative line all done by the youthful Malaysians. The national service, one way the other curtail the career of our youths, foreigners are way ahead of us. Do they care? A big NO.
They run this country as if they are always at war with us, whatever policies they fished out is of their own benefits.
Gilbert Goh, was delighted during the last May Day protest, one or two younger generations came forward to give the speech, where according to him was rare. National service, laws and the medias thus play a great role in reprogramming our youth.
The government had conquered the mind of our youth, they are proud of carrying guns and other toys. At the end of the day, they are the looser. You cannot use guns to monitor financial, datas, productions and sales.
The Government talk about productivity , the government are the major stumbling block. What do the youth future holds? bleak Where the government turning out wimps and cowards.
Do you blame Amos? Instead of sitting down and rationalize why the youths today getting restless, they did the most coward act.
The mature educated and rationalized Government, do not behave such a coward act as in futures, there will be more Amos with their bananas. We are truly a banana state.

5,"Singapore’s mainstream media Shin Min Daily has reported that their readers informed them that several ATM machines in various locations across the country – Jalan Sultan Textile Center, Serangoon Road, Block 37 Circuit Road and Block 301/302 Ubi Avenue 1 – were found splashed with black paint on the night of Wednesday (6th of May).
At least 6 of the ATM machines were found splashed with black paint. Incidentally, all 6 machines are situated by the roadside, which gives suspicion that the culprit could have been driving a vehicle.
Another reader, Manoj, who contributed a photo of the vandalism to mainstream media Stomp.
Screenshot from Stomp website
In Singapore, the splashing of paint is a vandalism act typically performed by creditors, often illegal moneylenders, to their debtors. The ATM machines featured in both reports seems to be POSB specific. The POSB bank was formerly a national bank before its privatization in 1998.
When the national bank was privatized, account holders who were aged 21 and above can no longer afford to keep funds below $500 without paying a monthly $2 fall-below fee. The move has been heavily criticized, even today, for making the poor poorer.
Do you think the $2 fall-below fee should be abolished?

7,"If you are going to make a complain about noise from construction sites, you might most probably have your complain dismissed.
The National Environment Agency (NEA) today revealed that up to 95% of more than 16,000 complains about construction noise level made in 2014 is unsubstantiated. Complains about noises were dismissed by the NEA’s own handheld noise meter. Residents who made the complain usually just want to find out if the noise level exceeds the limit of set by NEA. use noise meter applications on their phones. According to NEA, most of these noise meter applications on mobile phones are inaccurate and usually register higher reading by as much as 20 decibels.
Screenshot from NEA website
The NEA will only install noise meters for construction sites that has received a complaint.
However as it is not mandatory to install noise meters in construction sites, many companies would have received an indirect form of “tip-off” when they see NEA officers installing standalone noise meters at their construction site.
This could most probably explain the discrepancy between the NEA’s reading and resident’s complain.
Do you think it is better to mandate a noise meter recorder for all construction sites near residential buildings in Singapore?

8,"Singapore’s renowned psychiatrist and former scholar Dr Ang Yong Guan posted on his Facebook page questioned if the punishment of jail term and hefty fines is effective on the 16 year old YouTuber Amos Yee.
He reasoned that Amos’s response made the Singapore Government’s threat of jail term and bankruptcy inconsequential, and very likely causing Amos and other like-minded offenders in the future to be undeterred at all.
Screenshot from Dr Ang’s Facebook
Amos has flatly refused to plead guilty because he does not think what he did was wrong. Secondly, he is NOT interested in bail because the bail comes with several conditions attached which he must have found ridiculous. Thirdly, to many, bail equals freedom to get out of prison until trial date; to Amos, he doesn’t care as he is mentally prepared to remain in prison throughout the trial. Amos is making a lot of people (esp those who are charging him) frustrated / exasperated because his action and reaction defy simple explanation.
And to make things more frustrating for many in authority, Amos is prepared for the worse (“what’s the big deal to go to jail?”). Punishment is supposed to be a deterrent to Amos and other teens.! In this case, has it achieved its aim? Or worse, has it backfired?
 
"
9,"28th March 2015 – YouTuber Amos Yee created a video heavily criticizing the late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his son, the present Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. In the video, he made reference of Lee Kuan Yew and Jesus Christ, which led to many police reports made by Lee Kuan Yew supporters in the name of being religiously offended. The 2015 video was viewed nearly 1 million times, with almost 4000 likes and 17000 dislikes.
Photo from Youtube
29th March 2015 – Amos imposed an image of Lee Kuan Yew engaging in a sex act with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Over 20 police reports was made against the 16 year old over his video and he was arrested at around 12 noon. The posts were all taken down at the time of his arrest. The Singapore Police stated that the arrest was on the grounds of “deliberate intention of wounding the religious or racial feelings”, “threatening, abusive or insulting communication” and obscenity. The Singapore Government-controlled Straits Times reported that even his mother reported Amos to the police. His mother, Mary Toh, however later told The Online Citizen that she had filed a police report on 29 March, “not ... to have my son arrested”, but in response to Yee publishing the offensive image online despite her objections, leading her to fear for his safety.
31st March 2015 – Three charges were read out to Amos Yee, the first being seditious for making disparaging remarks against the Christian faith, the second for harassing and causing the supporters of the deceased Lee Kuan Yew to “feel distressed”, and the third for the offensive image. Amos was bailed out by his parents for $20,000 with bail conditions forbidding him from making any online posting on the internet. His father issued an apology to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
3rd April 2015 – Amos’s mother brought Amos to the Institute of Mental Health, but the 16 year old stopped going after two sessions because “it was a waste of time”.
14th April 2015 – Amos re-activated his account and re-posted the offending video. He even created a crowd fund page to gather funds to contest his legal case.
On 16th of April, Amos wrote a thank you note on his crowdfunding page saying:
Well the crowdfund for my courtcase is ongoing, and being dirt poor for several months, it’s exhilarating to see copious amounts of money coming in, even trolls and haters managed to put aside their differences, and donate 1 cent. I am truly humbled. The initial ‘wow’ factor when you see that first $1000 donated to your bank account, is quite intoxicating, and I can’t express how gratified I am for your support and donation.
17th April 2015 – Pre-trial hearing. Amos’s parents refused to post bail for Amos which led him to be remanded in Changi Prison for 3 days.
21st April 2015 – Amos was bailed out by Vincent Law, a family and youth counselor. Three lawyers, Alfred Dodwell, Chong Jia Hao and Ervin Tan, volunteered to represent Amos on pro bono basis.
29th April 2015 – Amos breached his bail conditions on not uploading content online again by making two blog posts; the first, questioned “the ridiculous terms of bail”, which he believed has absolutely nothing to do with his presence in court. The second, he revealed about his father’s violent inclinations and how he was beaten up by his father over the case.
30th April – While on his way to court, a 49 year old red shirt man slapped Amos Yee in public, but the former was later arrested. The Singapore’s mainstream media did not reveal who the 49 year old red shirt man is. Amos was ruled to have breached the bail and it is unknown if Vincent Law managed to get his $20,000 back. The charge on harassing Lee Kuan Yew and his supporters was stood down. Vincent Law did not post bail for Amos again because Amos doesn’t want him to. Singapore listed Popular Bookstore pounced on the slapping incident and posted a photo on Twitter laughing at Amos Yee.
Screenshot from Popular Twitter
Singapore Popular Bookstore later posted an apology to Amos Yee only after many Singaporeans complain against the distasteful post. Amos was in remand from 30th April to 7th May, who was handcuffed and dressed in prisoner’s clothes according to CPF blogger Roy Ngerng. It is unknown why Amos was given a prisoner’s treatment despite having no judgment ruled from the Singapore Court.
7th May 2015 – Amos Yee was reported to be wearing the prisoner’s white shirt and brown pants pleaded not guilty to the two charges. Amos has this to say about his charges in court:
“I do not have the intention to remove any of the videos that I have made,” said Yee according to Court documents, adding that he also would not remove the post involving Margaret Thatcher and Mr Lee Kuan Yew that was deemed obscene.  “I refuse to do this because it would not appease the public, as the video and posts will continue to be circulated, and also because doing so would suggest that I was sorry for the videos and my post, which I am not.”
11th May 2015 – 49 year old Neo Gim Huah has been identified after 11 days of anonymity. During the trial, he pleaded for sentences no harsher than a fine. The prosecution requested for only 2 weeks jail but the District Judge sentenced him 3 weeks. The owner of a aircon repair services company will serve his setence from 11th May onward.
12th May 2015 – Amos Yee has been found guilty even though he did not plead guilty. Despite having 32 police reports made, none of the 32 witnesses took the stand to appear in Court today. Amos Yee, through his Defence lawyer, said that he doesn’t want a probation and prefer to have a jail sentence. The Prosecution however wanted probation for the 16 year old. The Court has been adjourned following the result of a probation report.

In January 2014, the US Pentagon announced that the Singapore Government was ready to spend $2.43 billion to modernize its F-16 fighter jets. According to Wikipedia, it is believed that the Singapore Air Force bought as many as 70 F-16s from the United States in November 2014.
Do you think the Singapore Government is spending excessively on these weapons given the economical and peaceful development of South East Asia in recent years?

In the animation video, Amos Yee was seen showing disrespect to the deceased former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and an unnamed man in suit with an iron fist went hysterical over the disrespect. The man with an iron first whistled for a contingent of army and fighter planes to arrest Amos Yee.
The Taiwanese animator said:
Amos Yee made an incredibly insightful and informative video on the Singapore government, while at the same time dropping a few F-bombs and badmouthing Christians....and because Singaporeans are, how did Amos Yee put it? (censored)...so at least 15 police reports were lodged against Amos Yee because the little man decided to speak his mind. Really Singapore? You’re going to throw a 16 year old kid behind bars for having the guts to speak his mind?

12,"Below is a blog post submitted by a reader and is reproduced from Hilary’s blog
This day, last year 30 April 2014, I quit my job as a stewardess at SQ.
I’ve never done a “reflection” post but I’ve been planning to write one today for weeks now even if I weren’t Editor’s Pick. I really wanted to just get this out of my system
I was so so so happy. Even 3 weeks prior to quitting, I was so filled with relief and happiness when I finally submitted my resignation letter.
Ok it’s not a BAD job. There are always two sides to something.
Now that I’ve quit flying I feel like my lifespan has increased by 10 years- no more stress or pekchek-ness. After I quit, my parents told me that I became myself again. I was less grouchy, less quick to anger & I was nicer again.
I had a love-hate relationship with the job.
No doubt, on the surface it seems so glamorous and fun to be a crew, you get to shop in Paris, go to USA, have breakfast in Tokyo and lunch in LA but the work is tough. Crew really work very hard for the money!
You are not only a waitress in the air, but also a safety officer, baggage porter, bar tender, toilet cleaner, policeman, babysitter, maid etc. The list goes on. Many girls don’t know this before they join and they’re in for the shock of their lives once they start the job.
My batchgirls and I used to countdown so often till bond ended which also was the day we could finally quit. Some times we also asked each other to help us calculate how much we would have to pay back if we left now (before the bond ended).
Even during the 3 months of training, it was so tiring because we had so many lessons and also exams. Exams such as role-playing and MCQs on the computer and the passing mark was 80% sometimes. STC was literally like a secondary school, they way the trainers treated us, how our attire was so important etc. Maybe I’ll continue more in SQ training school part 2!
This was how I looked like during training! It was taken in May 2012 just before our graduation.
We all looked super toot After we bacame more senior, all our hairstyle and makeup changed, our ‘hump’ started to get higher the more senior we got. If you look at some stewardess you’ll see that their hair will be very high and poofy at the crown of the head- that’s the “stewardess hump”.
I enjoyed flying during my first few months. I enjoyed the work, probably because it was new to me and quite challenging. However, it went downhill after that.
I began to get sick of it. I could work well, I did my job well but because of the irregular eating/sleeping hours, I fell ill so many times especially during my first year. I took at least 7 days of MC during my first year and it’s wasn’t chao geng one.
I was so afraid that my probation would get extended (new crew are on probation for 6 months and after a review from your ward leader, they will become confirmed crew). There were so many stories of P plates (that’s what we call probationary crew) getting their probation extended because they took MC. It’s as if p plates weren’t allowed to fall sick.
I remember dragging my feet to work.
It got so bad to a point where I used to cry before going on flights. My batchgirl experienced this pre-flight blues too and I was quite comforted that I wasn’t the only one. I cried because I dreaded going to work, I dreaded the work itself- the nonstop labour intensive work where you literally walk to London.
Also I didn’t want to be away from my family. It was quite bad I really hated this and asked myself why I wanted this job so badly in the first place. Like I said, you won’t know what you’re in for until you finally join this industry.
In this job, you’ll miss out on birthdays, weddings, Christmas, Chinese New Years etc & it is very sad. In 2013 I spent Christmas Eve & day alone in the hotel room in New York & I felt so shitty.
There was once I was still on probation and was on standby. Standby meaning that control centre could call you up for any flight, especially if a crew had reported sick on that particular flight so you have to take her place.
My granny was critically ill, she could pass away any moment.
I took the trouble to get a doctor’s note from the hospital, saying that my granny was critically ill and I went all the way to control centre to pass them the note. They said ok, they would put a remark next to my roster:
“TURNAROUND FLIGHTS ONLY, GRANDMA CRITICALLY ILL”
They said they would call me up for turnaround flights so I could still be in Singapore.
That night, I received a call from control. I got called up for a flight.... TO AUCKLAND.
I called control immediately and told them why was I called up for a 4 day flight? I thought you were supposed to call me up for turnaround flights only?
And you know what they said?
“Girl, you cannot expect us to NOT call you up on standby you know??? You no need to work?”
I was boiling.
“I’m not telling you NOT to call me up, but I had a remark next to my roster about calling me up for turnaround flights only?”
This was the best, the woman replied
“WHAT REMARK? DONT HAVE!”
Wa. I wanted to flip table.
“YES THERE WAS. You want me to show you? I took a screenshot.”
She kept silent.
I continued
“What’s the point of me taking the trouble to get the doctors note and coming all the way to give it to you???”
Anyway long story short, I had to do the flight. Crew will know how people in control centre LACK compassion. I heard from a colleague that her granny had passed away a while ago and she called control crying and although she was given 2 days compassionate leave it wasn’t enough.
And somehow she wasn’t allowed to take no pay leave.
Although crying on the phone, control didn’t once say “oh I’m so sorry for your loss”. It’s as if they didn’t have any family. In the end, she went to get her wisdom teeth extracted just so she could get a weeks MC. She said she went to the funeral with a swollen face and bawled her eyes out.
Anyway back to my story, before the flight I told my IFS my situation and he asked me if I was sure I wanted to do this flight. I told him I didn’t have a choice cause I was on probation and I didn’t want things to get complicated and as a result I would get extended. During the flight, I couldn’t work at all, my heart and mind wasn’t focused that day. I kept thinking of my Granny lying unresponsive in the hospital.
When I got into Auckland, a few hours after checking into the hotel room, my mum called me. Granny passed away.
I bawled my eyes out. I was so so sad, so angry with control, so upset that I didn’t get to say bye to my granny. To make it worse, I was all alone in the hotel room crying non stop.
It was 2am at that time so I called my IFS and broke down over the phone.
He was really very nice. He didn’t sleep a wink and he called office and the hotel and they managed to get me on the next flight out the following afternoon. I was feeling so horrid on the way back in the plane.
I arrived in Singapore just in time for the wake. I cried when I saw my parents and my granny’s coffin.
I was thinking of really complaining about this but I decided not to. As a probationary crew i didn’t want to complicate things so I just had to suck thumb.
I remember always pulling a long face, (even though I had flown for more than a year) feeling my heart sinking as my mum turned into terminal 3 to drop me off. I always wished the car ride would last longer. With a really sad/grumpy face I would get out of the car, get my cabin bag from the boot and tell my mum
“I don’t wanna go flight!!! I don’t wanna go to Sydney” and very often I’m close to tears. I didn’t care that there were other people around waiting for their pickup I just couldn’t hide my sadness. It was really tough. Imagine a stewardess all dolled up with hair neat in a bun sulking and on the verge of tears.
My mum would then comfort me saying
“It’s ok!! Faster go and faster come back ok then we go out tgh and makan!!!”
Funny how I always sulk about going to work but once onboard, I’m ok. Like ok as in happy again, suddenly all the misery and dread about work is momentarily gone but maybe it’s just auto-pilot taking over. There are things to get done.
The work is really super labour intensive!! Crew will enter the aircraft about 20 minutes before boarding of passengers. Within these 20 minutes there’s so much to do!!!!!!
For stewardesses-
•Set up newspaper trolley, cut all the newspapers meant for 200+ people and display them nicely
•arrange the menucards
•dress the toilets with moisturiser, edt, toilet paper and rolls, make sure lavatory call light is working
• combine headset bags, 3 into 2 because 1 bag only has 50 headsets and there are probably more than 120 people in the cabin.
• heat up towels
• do a security sweep for the cabins
For the stewards
• organise galley
•make sure there’s enough coffee and tea pots and breadbaskets
•check meals with the caterer, make sure all the meals and special meals that’s supposed to be there, are there.
• for business class is even worse because there’s crockery instead of trays and the guys need to arrange everything.
In other airlines like Qantas, there’s NO ground duties to do. My dad’s friend worked there. The crew just make themselves a cup of coffee and wait for passengers to board. But for SQ is different. The crew do everything because it saves $
The girls are the ones who face and serve passengers most. Our duties are all cabin-related. The boys are in the galleys. They are like a chef in the kitchen so most of the times, they just do galley work like heating up meals, preparing drinks, arranging stuff etc. The stewardesses are the ones who face the wrath of passengers most of the time.
There was once when I was about 3-4 months into flying, I touched down into Singapore from Delhi early in the morning- it was an overnight flight. Needless to say I was so exhausted and delirious. Andrew was so sweet he came to pick me up from the airport.
He asked if we could swing by to the coffee shop to Dabao breakfast for himself and my family. I was so groggy and tired I thought okay, maybe it’s gonna take a while only. So he made a detour and I waited in the carpark while he went to dabao food.
By the way, stewardesses aren’t allowed to eat outside let alone be seen in their uniform apart from the airport. We can’t even take away food from the coffee shops that’s below our house when you’re in uniform. You have to change. What is this stewardess don’t need to eat is it?!
I was waiting in the car. I was so exhausted that even if there was a mosquito on my arm feasting on my blood I would just let it continue sucking. That tired. All I yearned for was to go home, remove my makeup and take a shower and sleep. Somehow Andrew took longer than usual and it felt like an eternity.
Suddenly I burst into tears. I sobbed because I was just so so so so so exhausted and this time Andrew came into the car all worried and shocked. Poor him, I even scolded him
“WHY MUST YOU DABAO BREAKFAST. IM DAMN TIRED ALREADY YOU KNOW YOU TAKE SO LONG SOMEMORE I WANT TO SLEEP!! BRING ME HOME NOW”
Andrew was stunned & drove me home ASAP.
You know the feeling of being so tired to the point where you can’t sleep? Happened to me so many times. When I get home I cry and remove makeup at the same time in my bed, when it takes me so long to fall asleep, I will just cry because I’m very “mang” & frustrated and unknowingly cry myself to sleep. It’s that bad.
I was very blessed. I didn’t get zapped by other senior crew (hierarchy is a big thing in SQ. Like even when you eat you must ask your senior to eat first etc). I didn’t get bullied or anything. So many people had very bad experiences but I am just very very blessed
In this job, you cannot argue or explain your actions. For example if your boss asks you “why you do this??” And if you try explaining yourself, it is seen as being argumentative and defensive. You should just say “sorry I won’t do it again”. Even if you are right, you are wrong sometimes. It doesn’t make sense and I hate this.
And if your boss tells you off and tells you how to do things the “correct” way, you just gotta suck thumb and say “oh I’m so sorry. Thank you for sharing with me I will take note”. I cannot stand it. Obviously I don’t mean it but I HAVE to do this to survive. No choice.
I think passengers are easier to deal with as compared to the crew. Once you have awesome crew, it’s considered a good flight even though you have nasty passengers. In SQ, crew fear passengers but in other airlines, the passengers fear the crew. We cannot say no. This is really bad because it has led to some passengers being so spoilt, unreasonable and they demand for the moon.
It’s like in a buffet, you pay $30 but you will eat $60 worth of food. Same goes for some of the passengers that fly SIA. Not all like this though. Quite sad that some Singaporeans especially behave this way. Whenever we see Singaporeans onboard, we sigh because it means there are bound to be complains.
During the pre-flight briefings our superiors will warn us especially when doing flights like HKG where there are so many Singaporeans onboard and HKG flights are flights with the HIGHEST complain rate.
Once the CEO was on my HKG flight, it was some kind of thing where they came down and try to see an actual meal service and have some hands-on experience.
We took a photo with him!! I remember I worked with such nice crew that day they are such nice people HKG flights can be really really crazy so really thank God for good colleagues.
We gotta be extra careful when handling Singaporeans because they aways think the crew are biased to the Ang Mohs. We are really not biased. It’s just that Ang Mohs are generally more friendly & they tend to engage in more conversation with the crew.
They would ask us questions about our personal life, where was our next flight, what country we loved most etc therefore just because we seem to make small talk or laugh with Ang moh passengers doesn’t mean we are biased towards them. They just happen to be a lot friendlier and interactive.
However there is one sad truth:
Ang Moh passengers tend to be more polite than Asian passengers.
I’ve met nasty Ang moh passengers before & I’ve met really nice & sweet Singaporean/Asian passengers as well.
When someone is nice to me, I will be nice to them too. Kindness begets kindness, it’s really natural for you to treat someone who is nice to you the same way.
But for those who are rude to me, I will still treat them with some respect cause after all they are paying customers however obviously I won’t be as nice to them as I am to really nice passengers.
It’s so difficult to be nice to nasty people.
But some Singaporeans/asians are really sooooo nice and when I do find these gems, I make sure I am extra extra nice to them!!! I will definitely go all the way to accede to their request. I also really like all the old makciks they are soooo cute and friendly!!!
Mostly when I see Singaporeans on board I will be nicer to them because... 自己人 what. Usually most are quite nice but there’s this large handful that really behaves as if they own the airlines. Very proud & very rude.
Let me give an example.
This is the difference between an Angmoh and a Singaporean:
*this does not represent ALL angmohs and ALL Singaporeans. Some Singaporeans are nice*
(THIS IS A TRUE ACCOUNT)
ANGMOH
🏻: Hi Sir welcome onboard!!!!!!!
🏼: Oh Hello!! How are you??
🏻: I’m fine thank you, how are you?
SOME SINGAPOREAN/ASIANS
🏻: Hi Sir welcome onboard!
🏻: Straits Times.
What is this? No greeting me back but straightaway asking for straits times? NO PLEASE OR THANK YOU SOMEMORE. This is too much. This happened to me on a Jakarta turn where there are so many businessmen. One businessmen actually did this “Straits Times” thing to me. Really very rude but obviously I couldn’t correct him
When asking for a drink:
(BTW THIS IS A REAL LIFE ACCOUNT )
Newzealander Lady
*presses call light*
🏻: Yes mam you pressed the call light? Can I help you?
🏼: Oh yes if it’s not too much trouble could I please get a coke? Only when you’re free, no hurry! Sorry for the trouble and thank you so much!
Heart melt. I love this kind of passengers. So polite & sweet how to say no??? No matter how busy I am I will stop, drop and roll to the galley to get her a coke. And when she got the coke, she was so thankful!!! She was like
“Oh thank you so much!!!! Sorry to trouble you again!!!”
One nice passenger sometimes can make up for 5 bad passengers
SINGAPOREAN LADY(True story)
*presses call light*
: yes mam you pressed the call light? Can I help you?
: ONE COKE.
No please, no thank you, no nothing.
Even when I brought the coke to her, SHE DIDNT SAY THANK YOU. Sometimes I just say “you’re welcome” even if they didn’t say thank you and I’ll walk away #likeaboss I really cannot stand rudeness!
You see? And people still say crew prefer Ang Mohs. It doesn’t mean you pay for a service means you can treat the service providers like they are below you. “Please” and “Thank Yous” are just very basic manners that everyone deserves from each other.
I just don’t like how passengers really think that SIA is a “premium airline” so they expect really “premium service” and abuse it.
There was once I did this flight to Sydney. It was a A380, it can take 399 passengers in economy class so you can imagine the chaos. Sydney flights are really really tough and A LOT of crew always take MC for Sydney flights, yes it’s THAT bad. You practically walk all the way to Sydney and you work until your panties become a G-string.
There was this young indian couple (I’m not being racist but it’s really easier for me to distinguish them) and an elderly Caucasian man seated in the same row. During boarding I was so busy running around trying to direct passengers to the seats and making sure the compartments are closed and everyone is seated. Suddenly this Indian man wanted my attention. He was those kind of educated indian who spoke good English.
He was talking to the old man next to him and they were gesturing about the hat. I was nearby so I could hear a little of their conversation and I could tell the old man didn’t really want to put his hat in the closet, he wanted to have it with him.
The indian man got my attention and asked
“Hilary right?” He looked at my nametag.
“Can you please hang this gentleman’s hat for him?”
The Indian man and the old man were completely unrelated, they were strangers.
So I smiled & said sure!! I’ll put it in the closet but that guy continued and said
“You know SIA is a premium airline, you should offer to hang the hat. We are paying so much for the service you know...”
I completely lost it. I was so busy already running around like a headless chicken, directing passengers to their seats, trying to ease the traffic jam happening in the already very narrow aisle...
I told him
“Sir, there are at least 200 people I have to take care of on this plane, YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY PASSENGER ON THIS PLANE. There are so many of you, I wouldn’t know if you have a hat that you want me to put in the closet. You have to TELL ME then I’ll know!!!” This was the first time I actually told a passenger off.
Then I turned to the sweet old man who was THE OWNER OF THE HAT and told him very sweetly
“Sir, I’ll put your hat in the closet ok? You can just tell me if you want it to be hung, don’t worry I’ll gladly do it for you”
Then I stared at the nosey man and left. THIS PEOPLE AH. I left to put the hat in closet and as I walked back, the man smiled at me sheepishly and said thank you. Buay tahan.
Usually yes, when I happen to see people with business jackets, I will definitely offer to hang it for them before they even ask me to. However sometimes I’m really so so busy running around because there are tons to do! Sometimes passengers have problems finding a space in the overhead compartment and I have to assist so I may not be able to anticipate your needs.
I was very blessed that I went for business class training and during my last 4 months of flying life, I worked in business class and it was HEAVENNNNNNNN.
It’s so much easier. On a 777 aircraft, 228 people in economy vs 46 passengers to serve , what would you choose? Of course 46 which was business class.
Business class service has more finesse, you don’t rush the meal service like in EY. It’s a table layout service so it’s starts with appetiser, maincourse, dessert and it ends with cheese and fruit.
Somehow the passengers in business class are a lot easier because all they want to do is sleep. Some do not even want to eat anything. We have to offer some passengers food and drinks because during the whole flight they don’t even take anything.
EY on the other hand.... Everybody wants to eat everything and drink everything lull period is not lull at all, the call lights go on and it’s like a Christmas tree seriously, so many adhoc orders like biscuits, beer, drinks, gin tonic etc even AFTER meal service. It’s really very scary sometimes. In business class however, lull period the crew are so free cause all the passengers are sleeping or doing their work.
This is why sometimes after business class is done with meal service, the leaders will send crew down to EY to help out with the meal service because there are just not enough men power in EY.
However I think this is only prevalent on SQ flights? When I took British Airways to London, NO BODY PRESSED THE CALL LIGHT AT ALL.
When they wanted a drink, people walked to the galleys to ask the crew for it. On SQ flights.... Some passengers who are just seated at the last row of the plane & the galley is just behind, they still press the call light and ask for a drink. This, we all cannot tahan.
On a 777, say it’s a full flight in EY. There are only 2 galleys & 6 crew to serve 228 passengers. It is really VERY little, even one extra crew would make such a big difference. I heard on thai airways, there are 2 stewardesses PER aisle!! On a 777 there’s only 1 stewardess per aisle. The leading (green uniform) has to “downgrade” and do a blue colour’s job and take the other aisle, at the same time she has to do her green uniform duties such as sales, write reports etc.
They are very poor thing, really worked to the bone.
Apart from all these negativity like the rude passengers and all, I really learned a lot. Like my tolerance capacity tank has increased so much and I’m able to take more shit. Hahaha nah but seriously, I’m thankful for being able to visit so many countries (although we have only 24 hours on shorthaul flights and 1.5 days on longhaul flights) and flying helped me save so much money! Plus because of this I managed to pay for my wedding.
Also another very important thing- I didn’t fall into the trap of buying branded things
I think also another major why I left was because I hated the culture and the vices associated with this job.
Flying can be bad especially if you end up falling into the life of vice.
It’s temptation island- pretty girls, handsome boys, 4 star hotel rooms.
Being surrounded in such a work environment you really really have to keep on guard and watch yourself to make sure you don’t give in to temptations like drinking, smoking etc. Not ALL crew drink and smoke and party but majority do.
If you have made “rules” for yourself, stand by it and don’t falter. It is very very hard I know.
I’m no exception. I’m only human & fall too.
Before I started flying, I’ve never said the cursed & swore or said the F word.
Once I started flying, every one around me was cursing and swearing so much. F here, F there, F every where. I was constantly in this toxic environment and I was hearing curse words non stop and unknowingly such things got to me.
I swore once onboard before because I was so fed up with some passengers because the call lights were going on so often and I walked up & down so many times and I was sleep deprived. I remember going into the galley and just cursing. I was so exasperated I just went
FTS LA.
It’s not me to swear. The worst things I would say is “WALAO”, “STUPID”, “IDIOT”, “ASSHOLE” and “SHIT”. I don’t curse but I just want to show you that how easy it is to be negatively influenced. I thought about it and decided that I have to put an end to this swearing because it wasn’t me. There is nothing to be proud of if you swear.
I stopped after that. It was hard because every one around me was cursing so freely but I succeeded.
Can you imagine other “bad habits” like drinking, smoking & splurging on branded bags? Once you start, you may not be able to stop.
Sometimes when I went to Chanel or Prada stores with crew & when they bought stuff, honestly it was very very tempting. Why was I even hesitating? I could well afford it. Every one was buying something, be it spending almost $200 on just a tiny Prada Credit Card holder or $50 on a key chain, sometimes they bought they just for the sake of it or simply just because they could.
I didn’t want to start on anything because these branded goods could be very very addictive.
In 2 years of flying, I only bought 2 expensive full priced branded items for myself- a Prada wallet & a Kate Spade Bag. I stopped there. I made sure I stopped at the Kate Spade bag because I wanted to give myself a “present” as I was going to quit the airlines in 2 months then. So the Kate Spade bag was my last expensive buy.
The best is not to walk into the trap cause sometimes it is hard to stop. Try not to even buy anything especially on impulse. If you’ve never tasted ice cream, you won’t crave for it.
I must have been a boring crew.
One chief asked me one day
“Do you drink?”
“No.”
“Go clubbing?”
“No.”
“Smoke?”
“No.”
“HARH?? THEN WHAT DO YOU DO?”
stay home with my mama lor.
Apart from the not so good side about the job, I really enjoyed the crew life for 2 years. Good money, the awesome food from different countries, the people I’ve met and the lessons I’ve learned.
So today last year, I touched down from my last flight- SQ2 SIN-HKG-SFO and I came back from Hong Kong.
My last #crewfie in the HKG hotel!
My last view from my office
Last few pictures I took of the business class galley.
The lovely ladies I worked with for my last flight
As you can see I stuffed the name list in my Kebaya top hahaha.
By right not allowed to do it but.... By left can
Last time in the cabin
I don’t know why I’m feeling so sad now lol.
A very happy me!!! Sorry after flight my lipstick and blusher were all gone hahaha see I told you HKG flights are really rough!
All in all, if you ask me if I would let my daughter fly next time, I would say no. I would definitely discourage her but it’s also dependent on one’s personality type. My parents were crew before and upon hearing my interest to join the airlines, they actually told me not to. The airlines today and 30 years ago is so different.
It was like a holiday last time. They used to have 7 nights in Paris but now, only 2 nights. What sights are you going to see? When you reach the hotel room you just crash out of fatigue and when you wake up its God knows what time already. The next day is your last day in that country and what can you do with a fatigued body? How much can you chiong to see? And next morning, back in the metal tube on the way back to Singapore.
The kind of fatigue a crew experiences is unlike normal fatigue. It’s hard to explain, it’s like a combination of physical fatigue, mental fatigue, being on your feet for hours and also the result of being stuck in a metal tube with low oxygen levels and breathing in recycled air filled with millions of germs.
30 years ago crew earned $5k a month. 30 years later they earn minimum $3.5k a month. On good months $5k but why is it that 30 years ago and now crew are earning the same?? Actually lesser now.
Last time if Meepok was 20 cents but now it’s $3 shouldnt the pay go up too??? And the company keeps decreasing the allowances, super not worth it to fly now.
This was circulating around when we heard that our bonus was only gonna be 1.48!
I’m sure now you understand more, full load is really not funny especially when we don’t have enough of crew! We work so hard but the money keeps going down and bonus so little
If you really want to survive in this job, the only way is to eat humble pie. There’s no “explaining” yourself because in SIA culture it is deemed as defensive and argumentative. I find this ridiculous to be honest. So whatever or whoever corrects you, just say sorry & thank you.
SIA stands for SORRY I APOLOGISE and applicable for fellow crew & passengers.
Also after working in this service line, I’ve come to understand how important it is to be grateful to whoever has served you. A small “thank you” can do wonders.
Even after a rough flight, standing at the door bidding passengers goodbye, even a simple “thank you so much for taking care of us” just warms my heart and makes me so happy that suddenly all the tiredness and anger that was in me just dissipates. It’s like all my slogging during the flight was all worth while.
Now I make sure I am even nicer to people like waitresses. When my food takes a little longer than usual, I’m more patient because I can understand it may not be their fault. Same, if the plane was delayed by weather and the passengers scold us. It’s not our fault I didn’t make it rain or have a thunderstorm but we always take the blame because we are the last people the passengers get to see.

So true!! And sometimes we also have to be money changers and experts about airports in other countries. We get asked “what’s the exchange rate of x country and x country?” Errrrrrrr do I look like a money changer to you?
What gate to go to at Frankfurt airport for my connecting flight?? Errr I REALLY DONT KNOW
The only thing that people say that really hurts crew a lot is when they look down on us. They think being a stewardess is a lousy job, a job where people who are not smart/can’t study do. Just a high class waitress serving and cleaning up after people.
This has happened so many times to many crew and one stewardess told me this story as it happened to her.
There was this Singaporean father and his young daughter.
The father told the daughter and pointed at the stewardess and said
You better study hard next time. If not you’ll end up like this Aunty here becoming a stewardess
He said it in front of her.
She told me that she felt so so so angry & hurt.
The best thing is, THIS STEWARDESS HAD A DEGREE AND SHE WAS FROM A LOCAL UNI.
These days most crew are degree holders. Even if they aren’t, you shouldn’t even look down on them. It’s really very very hurtful.
(Image from Google)
This is really so so so true and a lot of people are unaware of this.
I know some people might think that we asked for it because we chose to fly. But honestly if you ask all the crew, we really didn’t know what we were in for and most of us really regret. The work is totally opposite from what you imagine it to be.
This is why so many crew are quitting & therefore there’s cabin crew recruitment so so often.
The younger crew always can quit anytime because they have a degree, they are young.
Imagine the crew who have been flying since 1980s? Most of them only have an O levels cert & if they quit, where are they going to go? There will be no other job now that pays you almost $4.5k especially with a O levels cert. These crew are stuck here for 30 over years, they cannot afford to leave this job no matter how sick & tired they are of it.
Sometimes, passengers are really so sweet. They would buy food for the crew for example tidbits, snacks etc and this simple thing makes us soooo happy because we feel like we are being appreciated! & it’s a good way to score points too
When I flew as a passenger on SQ from London to Singapore, I bought a dozen + 3 Krispy Kreme donuts (15 crew on 777) for the crew.
They didn’t know I was a crew then and I gave it to them before the flight took off & they were so so so happy!!! One by one they came to me and thanked me for the donuts. Even as I disembarked from the aircraft, they thanked me again. So this is how I always show my appreciation to crew onboard! It really will make their day.
I really want to share these because I know a lot of girls are dying to join the airlines just like I did. & they really don’t know what they’re getting themselves into and it’s too late to quit once they get a rude shock. They’re stuck in this for 18 months!
But honestly if you want to fly, just fly for 2 years and leave. It’s a good experience no doubt & you will definitely learn A LOT.
People say that if you don’t leave before 5 years, you are stuck in the airlines for life and it’s really a dead end job.
Getting a promotion is so hard. You have to go back to training school, take courses like wine course, ACTA course, join a CCA etc and all these on your off days you know? It’s as if you don’t need to spend time with your family and after your course, off you fly again. No life.
And also another reason not to fly for so long is because of health.
I’ve read articles before and apparently a cabin crew who has flown for more than 3 years cannot donate their organs. It’s due to all the bad side effects of the job on your health.
You’re exposed to so much radiation, ultraviolet rays and free radicals etc.
I’m not sure how true the article is & I can’t find it anymore.....
But I’ve heard stories of stewardesses having difficulties conceiving. Some have to quit first, rest their bodies for a few months and only then are they able to conceive.
So just imagine the amount of stress flying puts on your body!
Actually come to think of it, I need to thank SQ for 2 years of training because although I’m no longer a stewardess......... I STILL FEEL LIKE ONE.
Every day I am taking care and serving ONE passenger who is in suites class. From serving him his meals, to washing his clothes, putting blanket over him when he sleeps.... NONE OTHER THAN ANDREW.
Very tough passenger and I’m on this flight that’s NEVER ENDING lol!
This passenger is really demanding and annoying. Always pressing the call light and asking me to get him water even though the “galley” is nearby.
What’s worst, I GET SEXUALLY HARASSED BY HIM
Today this passenger left me a note because I was busy working (lol actually dayre-ing)
I really don’t know whether to laugh or cry when I saw his note
This flight will NEVER END

13,"What is a Progressive Wage Model?
From the low level PAP grassroots volunteers to the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, none of them can tell you its definition without taking a dump at Minimum Wage. The only likely answer you will get is “The Progressive Wage Model is better than Minimum Wage. Minimum Wage has more shortfalls than benefits.” You can even ask the man who concocted this term himself, Lim Swee Say, and this is what he said about its actual definition:
“The third component is the labour movement’s progressive wage system where four factors are pulled together to improve the workers’ well-being. These are skills, productivity, career path and the workers’ wages.”

However his definitions were all nullified by the first case of Progressive Wage Model. In 2014, cleaning companies are legislated by law to be licensed, with licensing requirements to “improve standards and productivity”, and more importantly, install a Minimum Wage of $1000 for all cleaners. This particular case raises questions about the fundamental attributes of a Progressive Wage Model:
1) Isn’t a Minimum Wage the reason why we have Progressive Wage Model? If companies are required to pay more then raising salaries, like enforcing compulsory training programmes as required by PWM, isn’t it accurate to say the PWM is worse than the Minimum Wage for employers?
2) Minimum Wage is enacted across all industries, but the PWM is only for a specific trade. So is it right to say some low level trades deserve to be abused without a Minimum Wage?
3) If PWM is linked to productivity, shouldn’t every cleaner be paid according to how productive they are instead of having a blanket $1000 Minimum Wage?.
4) PWM claims to be trade-specific. But 3 years since its inception in 2012, only the cleaning trade has been legislated. What about security guards? Construction workers? Dish washers? Or any other trades? PWM is obviously NOT trade-specific. The officials claim that cleaners are only the first phase, so how long will PWM be enforced across all trades? 50 years?
A Progressive Wage Model is just a convenient excuse to avoid the Minimum Wage. How else would you define a Progressive Wage Model then?
Do you think Chan Chun Sing will do a better job than Lim Swee Say did?

14,"Tower Transit Systems has recently just won the tender of bus service provision at the west side of Singapore. The London-based bus operator is a subsidiary of Transit Systems, an Australian-based public transport company. Tower Transit Systems will create another subsidiary, called the Tower Transit Singapore, after announcements were made about its winning bid of the bus route tender which was called in April 2013 by the Land Transport Authority.
Screenshot from Google Map
26 bus routes serving Bukit Batok, Jurong and Clementi will be based in Bulim bus depot at Jurong West Avenue 2. The bus depot will be opened on 17 August 2015, with bus number 77 and 106 being the key tenants of Bulim Bus Depot. The depot is able to accommodate about 500 buses and will serve as a maintenance center, bus interchange and a rest zone for bus drivers.
The Bulim bus depot is created to support the higher number of buses which are funded by the taxpayers-funded $1.1 billion Bus Services Enhancement Programme (BSEP) announced in 2012. According to the Minister of Transport Lui Tuck Yew, the BSEP was created to improve bus services and defray the cost of bus operations.
It is unknown if the $1.1 billion Singaporean taxes will be channeled to help the foreign bus operator, Tower Transit, to defray bus operation costs. In a press release by Land Transport Authority, the LTA said that bus depots will be “handed over” to bus operators:
6. Under this framework, the LTA has developed and handed over one bus park at Upper Changi Road East (operated by SBS Transit) and another at Woodlands (operated by SMRT) in January 2013.
Do you think it is right for LTA to “hand over” a tax-funded bus depot over to private bus operators to make profits out from Singaporeans?

One such eatery is Afganistan Restaurant at Tampines St 23, whereby many food stalls do not display prices, e.g the Prata Stall. It used to display prices before it last renovation. After revamped, the prices (display) are gone.
Other eateries (which do not display their food price) are Economic Rice Stalls operated by Chinese at Food Courts. The definition of meat could be ridiculous: TOFU with salted egg is considered as Meat price, long bean with few pieces of fishcake slices is also considered Meat price, veg with ikanbilis also considered as Meat price.
Please help to raise awareness of food scam in SIngapore eateries.

16,"Based on Chinese news reports, Li Huabo was a former junior finance bureau officer from PoYang county, JiangXi province in China, before he fled the country last year after allegedly embezzling 94 million yuan from special funds set up to help the county’s one million poor residents. Li Huabo fled with his wife and two teenage daughters, eventually settling in Singapore. He and his family were later given Singapore PR status by the Singapore government.
Invest $1.5m to get PR for whole family
According to the Straits Times news report “Ex-official sent back to China by S’pore” (May 10) – “Li (Huabo) qualified for PR in 2010, after he invested $1.5 million in an approved fund in Singapore.”
On the first day of his trial on Tue (11 Sep 2013), the court heard that Li managed to invest S$1.5 million in an approved fund in 2010 to help him qualify as a PR as part of the EDB’s Global Investor Programme (GIP), despite earning only 3000 yuan (S$583) a month as a junior govt official in China.
The GIP is actually administered through Contact Singapore, an alliance between the Singapore EDB and MOM. It said that the GIP eases the way for foreigners to set up and operate businesses or to invest in Singapore. Contact Singapore assists by linking up entrepreneurs and investors with local business networks, as well as facilitating a range of immigration processes for their entry and stay here. This includes helping the foreigner and his family to apply and obtain PR status in Singapore.
Under GIP, the foreigner can choose one of the following investment options:
Successfully cheated Contact Singapore (EDB) to get PR
It was revealed at the 2013 trial that Li did not mention during the application process that he was a Chinese government official. Shieh said he was unaware of this and added that under Chinese laws, Chinese government officials were not permitted to apply for foreign PR. Shieh allegedly claimed Li Huabo said he was the general manager of a firm called Jingdezhen Jingyu New Energy Development.
Li Huabo started to plan his move to Singapore in 2010, one year before he fled. He approached Edwin Shieh, the director of ADH Group Co Ltd to facilitate the immigration process and pass the GIP application. The GIP application itself is tedious and require relevant business documents to back up an applicant’s claims:
ASSESSMENT CRITERIA FOR GIP APPLICATION
(a) You must possess at least 3 years of entrepreneurial and business track record and must produce audited financial statements of your company for the last 3 years.
(b) Your company must only be engaged in one or more of the industries listed in Annex A in the GIP factsheet.
(c) Your company’s turnover must be at least S$50 million in the year immediately preceding your application, and at least S$50 million per annum on average for the three years immediately preceding your application. You should submit the financial statements of your company with the highest turnover. You may also consolidate your businesses, all of which must only be engaged in one or more of the industries listed in Annex A in the GIP factsheet, to meet the minimum turnover criteria.
(d) If your company is privately-held, you should have at least 30% shareholding in the company. Your role in the company, as well as the growth and profitability of your company would be taken into consideration.
Photo from Contact Singapore
Apparently, Contact Singapore, an initiative by EDB and MOM, did not do their due diligence to scrutinize the documents Li Huabo and his immigration agent submitted.
Li Huabo and his family’s PR status was granted in Nov 2010 through the GIP scheme. Li Huabo then opened several UOB bank accounts and later transferred the money to these accounts as well as accounts of other PRCs in Singapore.
How many of such “PRs” out of 348,654 new PRs?
So, since the fact of the reality is that he was able to get PR status for not just himself but his entire family by merely investing “$1.5 million in an approved fund in Singapore” – makes you wonder how many of such PRs there are amongst the 348,654 new PRs granted in the last eight years, from 2007 to 2014?
How many corrupted cases do you think EDB could have unwittingly let into Singapore because of their negligence?

17,"A corrupted former government official from Jiangxi Province China has been extradited after serving 15 months for transferring S$242,820 into his Singapore bank accounts. The 51 year old PRC man, Li Huabo, arrived in Singapore in January 2011 and he was arrested in March 2011 for being involved in an embezzlement of more than S$19.27 million from the PRC government into Singapore banks. The arrest happened barely two months after Li Huabo landed in Singapore, however, he was somehow granted Singapore Permanent Residency while he was waiting for his verdict in 2013.
Photo from South China Morning Post
When Li Huabo was arrested, he claimed that the Singapore Government will try to help if he cooperated. If he didn’t, he could face heavier punishments, or even the death penalty, in the hands of the China Communist Government. Li Huabo refused to cooperate and was charged with three counts of banking stolen funds.
Yesterday (May 9), Li Huabo and his family’s Permanent Residency has recently only been revoked, despite been serving his jail sentence for 15 months. He been sent back to China following his release yesterday. The man in the top 100 wanted list of China will likely face the death penalty.

According to the Bloomberg’s interview, during the investigation and prosecution period from March 2011 to his verdict trial on April 5th 2013, Li Huabo was given a monthly cheque of S$4,000 from the Singapore Government when the latter froze his bank accounts. During this period waiting for trial, he was doing nothing staying at his three-bedroom luxury condominium.
Do you think Amos Yee too should be given a S$4,000 monthly allowance while waiting for his verdict?
Why does Singapore ICA approve his Permanent Residence without requesting for Police Clearance from China?

18,"Responding to media queries over the shut down of The Real Singapore (TRS) by the Media Development Authority, the Minister for Communications and Information Dr Yaacob Ibrahim said that MDA did the right thing and what TRS did was aboveboard (straightforward).

“It is aboveboard, you can see all the evidence we have put forward in terms of the materials in which they have published.”
However this statement by Minister Yaacob could be sub judice contempt of court as the TRS editors are still on bail and pending court verdict. The next pre-trial conference is on May 18.
As a high level Government Minister, Yaacob’s comment will likely influence court’s judgment and impugn the integrity of the court.
Do you think the Singapore Police Force should arrest Minister Yaacob for investigation over sub judice contempt of court?

19,"The Singapore Healthcare facilities is touted as one of the world’s best in the world. However, what is the point when Singaporeans are priced out of access to these facilities because we have to pay part of the medical bill in cash? It has been my suspicion that the Singapore Healthcare system is fully self-funded by Medisave Account Holders, and that the Singapore Government do not even have to pay a single cent for healthcare subsidies.
Infographic from People’s Action Party website
A simple search up the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) website ascertained my belief:
$64.9b in Total Medisave Balance
According to the MOH web site – Total Medisave Balance was $54.5, $60.0 and $64.9 billion, in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.
Govt Health Expenditure less than increase in Total Medisave Balances?
Since Government Health Expenditure (operating and development) was $4.8 and $5.9 billion, in FY12 and FY13, respectively – does it mean that from a cashflow perspective – there was hardly any Government spending at all?
For example, the increase of $5.5 billion in Total Medisave Balances from 2011 to 2012, was actually more than the the Government Health Expenditure of $4.8 billion in FY12.
Annual Medisave contributions exceed total Medisave withdrawals + Govt Health Expenditure?
Also, since Medisave contributions in excess of the Medisave Contribution Ceiling (renamed to Basic Healthcare Sum this year) were transferred to the Special Account – and not reflected in the Total Medisave Balances – the excess of Medisave contributions annually against total Medisave withdrawals for medical expenses and premiums plus Government Health Expenditure, may actually have been even higher.
Making money from healthcare?
And of course, the Government has been keeping the difference between the annualised returns derived from our Medisave funds and the interest rate paid on the Medisave account.
Moreover, as healthcare costs and premiums continue to rise way above general inflation – the higher interest paid on the Medisave account may in a sense, be eventually consumed in the future. 
 It is safe to assume that each one of us has at some point browsed through  cool instagram captions and quotes Selfie Captions and some Cute
As an analogy – what’s the point of giving you a higher interest rate when I can keep increasing the costs that you have to pay every year into the future?
Only 1.2% of Medisave have been withdrawn?
Don’t you find it rather strange that despite more treatments and higher amounts that you can use your Medisave for – the ratio of the Amount Withdrawn For Direct Medical Expenses to Total Medisave Balances, decreased from 1.3 to 1.2 per cent, from 2011 to 2013?
For example, only $799 million was withdrawn to pay for medical expenses from the $64.9 billion Total Medisave Balances in 2013.

20,"Photo of MND Minister Khaw Boon Wan from Channel News Asia
There has been much news about the Ministry of National Development taking the opposition-run Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC) to court to seek approval to override the mandate of the elected Members of Parliament and appoint ‘independent’ auditors to oversee future payments done by the town council. The Workers’ Party-run town council is suspicious of this blatant encroachment into the running of its town council.
The Workers’ Party (WP) also deemed the government’s choice of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to serve as auditors for the town council as inappropriate because this is the same accounting firm that had flagged major lapses in the town council’s records and that there is a potential conflict of interest.
AHPETC also mentioned that during the audit of the town council, there were disagreements with PwC and this may cause bias in the way PwC tries to handle the functioning of the town council in future.
The WP-run town council did not object to the government wanting to appoint auditors. It merely wants the auditors to be truly independent.
Let’s look into the another aspect of AHPETC’s running of the town council that the PAP always brings up – the rates paid to the managing agent, FM Solution and Services (FMSS). PAP alleged that WP has lost millions of dollars and all this money has gone into the pockets of WP’s friends at FMSS.
However, to date, the PAP has yet to produce convincing evidence for this allegation. The issue of paying their managing agent higher is not as scary as some imagine. Aljunied GRC has always (even under PAP) paid unusually high rates. It has always had expensive managing agents.
Moreover, the high rates paid by AHPETC to the managing agent could have occurred as a result of a lack of competing bids. No town council managing agent wanted to work for WP’s town council even when a tender was called.
Furthermore, the rates paid to FMSS were still legal and no law was broken by simply paying the managing agent those rates. Hence, the PAP can at most claim that it is morally wrong. Under the Town Councils Act, a town council member can be awarded a contract as long as he discloses his interest and recuses himself from voting. Thereafter, the others can award the contract to him.
For years, the PAP has been awarding contracts to their members and former members, in addition to grassroots leaders’ businesses. EM Services and Action Information Management (AIM) are just a few examples. In the case of the PAP, since they have greater political dominance, members of one town council can make bids at other PAP town councils, or they can just award the contract to grassroots members. Thus, the issue isn’t about conflicts of interest. The PAP is also guilty of such things. But it’s all legally accepted so neither the PAP nor the WP can be blamed for that.
AHPETC is short of $14 million of grants that the government was supposed to give them. In February 2015, Minister Khaw Boon Wan who is also the PAP chairman, said that the government will withhold $7 million of grants and amend the town councils act. But only this week, a report in the mainstream media said that with $14 million of government grants being withheld, AHPETC is “technically insolvent“.
Government grants are supposed to be given annually. Why is 2 years’ worth of grants being withheld from AHPETC?
AHPETC’s own auditors gave a report that they could not verify the exact state of their books. Then when Auditor General’s Office (AGO) went to look at their books to find signs of wrongdoing but couldn’t find any. All they found was that some processes were not standard, like getting 3 quotes.
On what basis are the grants being withheld? If you don’t like the processes, are those grounds justifiable? Or is MND making this up as they go along, much like what MDA did with The Real Singapore?
There is no precedent for withholding town council grants which are essentially taxpayers’ monies. Nor is there a precedent for forcing the government’s accountants on a town council that has been competently providing services to the residents for the last 4 years with few complaints being made about the cleanliness of the town or services like maintenance of common facilities.
Are grants being withdrawn just to cripple the WP-run town council?
The PAP is playing up the bogeyman that AHPETC is insolvent and will have no money by June. They are probably hoping that it will instigate residents in Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East to rise up as a collective mass and condemn the WP.
But it is clear for most residents that the WP-run town council would not have become insolvent if not for the PAP withdrawing 2 years’ worth of government grants. This is a problem created by the PAP, so it is pointless to condemn the WP which is even now trying to think of ways to solve the problem and serve their residents rather than complain about the injustice inflicted upon them.

21,"About 100 Singaporeans are now at Hong Lim Park holding a vigil for Amos Yee tonight. Organized by activist Shelley Thio, the event highlights the oppressive behavior of the Singapore Government on a 16 year old, the cyber bullying and online abuse by pro-PAP supporters and the physical assault Amos Yee suffered.
The event’s summary is as follow:
“A 16 year old teenager faces the prospect of imprisonment just because he posted a video online which the government found objectionable. Not only is he being persecuted by the State, Amos Yee has been subject to verbal abuse and threats online. He was even assaulted outside court by an unknown man. Whatever punishment that is meted out by the courts on Tuesday, when the verdict will be announced, the Community Action Network invites you to show your solidarity with Amos, and support freedom of expression in Singapore.”
Screenshot from Facebook
CPF Blogger Roy Ngerng who has been a close friend of Amos Yee ever since the latter was prosecuted is also present at the event. Roy Ngerng who is now facing a defamation suit by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong for his CPF articles is not allowed to give a speech in public.
According to a reader, the police forbade the use of candlelight. The people at the event ended up using handphone and torchlight.
Here are some photos of the event happening right now:

22,"The 49 year old red shirt man who slapped 16 year old Amos Yee and continued to taunt him after it has been finally identified after 11 days of anonymity.
Video of the slapping incident by Channel NewsAsia:

Neo Gim Huah was caught on video slapping Amos Yee while the latter was on his way to court for a hearing on 30th April 2015. He was subsequently caught by the Singapore Police on the next day (May 1st) at 2am.
During his court trial today, he said he was very offended by Amos Yee’s video which insulted the deceased former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. He deliberately waited for Amos Yee on that day to slap him as he knew the reporters will be present, “so that the world at large would know that Amos Yee was being taught a lesson”.
In his own words, Neo Gim Huah said:
“I thought by giving him one slap would instil fear in him, and also let him know what are the ways of the world.”
Neo Gim Huah pleaded guilty and even gave a long mitigation plea in Chinese asking for leniency before sentencing. He said that this is his first offense and pleaded the court for a fine and not anything harsher because he is worried about his wife and three children.
The prosecutors asked for a 2 weeks jail on the basis that Neo Gim Huah’s actions were pre-mediated and that the Court should show it is unacceptable to take the law into one’s own hands.
The District Judge Ronald Gwee sentenced him to a 3 weeks jail beginning today. However, the maximum penalty for voluntarily causing hurt to others is a 2 years jail and a fine up to $5,000.
What do you think of the verdict?
"
23,"In a Parliamentary response to Opposition Member of Parliament (MP) Png Eng Huat’s question over whether the Singapore Government will consider setting up a centralized system to check foreign degrees for public service agencies, the Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean flatly shot down the idea. Workers’ Party MP Png Eng Huat has raised this question because of several high profile cases of fake degree holders appearing on the media.
DPM Teo said he believes that the public service agency responsible for hiring a candidate with foreign qualifications, is already in the best position to decide his relevance and suitability for the job.
However DPM Teo did not clarify if holders of fake degrees from degree mills, can be allowed to continue working in the public service agencies even when their fake qualifications are not taken into account during the hiring process.

A recent high profile case featured a former Indian National and present New Citizen, Nisha Padmanabhan, working as an Applications Consultant for the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) . However IDA has stood by their decision to hire Nisha, the new cititzen exposed to have a degree from a known degree mill. They justified the decision saying that she genuinely thought that SPU was a proper university and that her MBA was real.
Here is what IDA said:
Hi everyone,
Thank you for your patience in awaiting the outcome of our investigation into the case concerning Nisha Padmanabhan.
We have conducted a thorough investigation into the matter, taking into account the various concerns raised. We have assessed the facts and interviewed Nisha Padmanabhan, and are satisfied that she did not deceive or mislead IDA by citing the MBA in her CV when she applied to IDA for a job.
Nisha had enrolled for an MBA distance learning programme with Southern Pacific University in 2005 when she was residing in Malaysia. She had genuinely believed her MBA programme to be bona fide, and she had put in effort to obtain the qualification. In retrospect, Nisha acknowledges that she should have been more discerning in assessing the quality of the university which she had selected to pursue her distance learning programme.
While IDA did not take Nisha’s MBA into account when hiring her, as the job only required a Bachelor degree-holder, we did look at her relevant skillsets and past work experience as she was a mid-career hire.
There is a news report on this in Straits Times, and you may wish to read it here: http://www.straitstimes.com/.../employee-cleared-misleading-i...
Thank you.

24,"I am disappointed with the verdict of Neo Gim Huah, who was jailed 3 weeks for voluntarily causing hurt against 16 year old Amos Yee. This is what Neo Gim Huah said of his actions in Court today:
“I remember how arrogant he was...That’s why I thought by giving him one slap would instill fear in him, and also let him know what are the ways of the world.”
“Neo had said that he had intentionally hit Yee in the presence of the media as he “wanted the assault to be publicised so that the world at large would know that (Yee) was being taught a lesson”
Photo from The Straits Times
This is clearly not only one charge of voluntarily causing hurt. By his own admission in Court, there are two other valid charges against Neo Gim Huah:
1) An attempted criminal intimidation to make Amos Yee plead guilty
2) A subjudice contempt of court to influence Court’s judgment on an ongoing trial

25,"The Singapore Parliament today passed a new law requiring all third-party taxi booking applications like GrabTaxi and Easy Taxi to be regulated under the Land Transport Authority. Failure to register will result in a maximum penalty of $10,000 fine and 6 months jail.
However the regulation is filled with restrictions that will dampen the competitiveness and flexibility of the third-party taxi booking applications.

Photo from The Straits Times
One key concern is the function of specifying destinations, which is a very popular option for taxi drivers who are ending their shifts. Using third-party taxi applications, taxi drivers have the option to not pick up a customer based on where he is going. The new regulation by Minister Lui Tuck Yew will ban such option for taxi drivers:
“We do not want taxi drivers to cherry-pick their fares. This is consistent with the approach that we have taken for street hails.”
Although Minister Lui Tuck Yew added that commuters can still choose to indicate their destinations if they think this will increase their chances of getting a taxi even when they are not compelled to do so, taxi drivers are still unable to choose their customers based on destinations.
Do you think our taxi drivers will have lesser income avenue after this regulation by Minister Lui Tuck Yew?

26,"Shrouded in opacity and secrecy, the actual amount in the Singapore’s National Reserves has always been a question and kept away even from its sole key holder, the Singapore President. The Singapore Government has recently announced the issuance of the new Singapore Savings Bond.
Marketed as “risk-free” and having “decent interest returns” by the Government-controlled mainstream media, The Straits Times, the new Singapore Savings Bond however have not faced the real question of its existence:
Why is the Singapore Government raising money from issuing bonds?
The issuance of bond, is a debt to a country where the Government need to honour the debt by paying interests every year. Since 1965, the Singapore Government never once have to resort to issuing bonds, or simply put in, borrow to pay for its policies. It even accumulated a wealth of National Reserves through years of surplus, no thanks to the Singapore Government’s shrewd taxing policies that mainly collected the bulk of indirect taxes on the middle class and low income.
According to the International Monetary Fund data, the Singapore Government owes debt amounting to 111% of GDP – among the top 10 most debt-ridden countries in the world. The debt is mainly owed to the people’s retirement fund, the Central Provident Fund, where the Singapore Government legislated laws to borrow this cheap fund with low interest. The issuance of Singapore Savings Bond will no doubt push the Singapore Government into further debt, and with higher interest obligations than the CPF – or in Straits Times’s lyrical wax: “decent returns”.

In the recent years, there have been speculations about the bankruptcy of Singapore’s two sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings (TH) and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), due to high profile losses from investments like this, this, this, this, this, this and etc. As the Singapore Government has no jurisdiction over foreign press, more of its investment losses were reported and widely shared among Singaporeans in the internet age.
Another sign of worry about the Singapore Reserves, is the continual raising of the CPF Withdrawal Age, CPF Minimum Sum and the introduction of mandatory annuity, CPF Life, and insurance, CPF Life Medishield. It is getting even harder to have confidence about Singapore’s financial health when the Singapore Government insisted that transparency is not important, according to the Singapore Government website that “factually dispels doubts”:
“It is not in our national interest to publish the full size of our reserves.”
The Singapore Government however has not explained its intention of issuing the new Singapore Saving Bonds, despite the fact that such bonds is going to incur greater debt obligations.
What do you think is the real reason the Singapore Government need to borrow?
"
27,"During a Court hearing today, 16 year old YouTuber Amos Yee, through his defence lawyer, requested to be jailed instead of going for probation after being sentenced guilty by the Judge.
The two charges faced by Amos Yee – one for making offensive remarks against the Christian faith and one for circulating an obscene image of Lee Kuan Yew engaging in a sex act with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher – are liable for up to a maximum penalty of 3 years.

However in a strange twist of fate, the prosecution doesn’t want Amos Yee to be jailed and requested for the judge to give the 16 year old counselling and probation. This stance adopted by the prosecution is inconsistent given that Amos Yee have gone on trial as an adult.
Like an adult, Amos Yee was remanded in Changi Prison and appeared for court hearings in shackles and handcuffs.
The court has adjourned sentencing pending a probation report for Amos Yee. The Judge has given Amos Yee a lowered bail at $10,000 with no bail conditions.
AGC wanted to put more conditions on Amos’s bail but it was denied by the Judge. CPF Blogger Roy Ngerng who was present at the hearing said:
“Just now, AGC wanted to put more conditions on Amos’s bail. But the judge wouldn’t have any of it.
AGC wanted Amos to take down his article and video as part of the bail conditions.
Judge told AGC off and said that the take downs should not be part of the bail conditions. It should be part of the sentence, not the bail conditions, she said.
Judge then ruled that Amos can be bailed without conditions.”

28,"Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu are among the three Singaporean athletes who were inducted into the Singapore Sports Hall of Fame. The two ex-PRC new citizens received their award from Minister Lawrence Wong this evening (May 12) at the Team Singapore 28th SEA Games Flag Presentation.
In 2005 and 2007 respectively, the Singapore Government fast tracked the Singapore citizenship of China-based table tennis players Wang Yue Gu and Feng Tian Wei under the Foreign Sports Talent Scheme. They subsequently won several silver medals in various international competitions, with the gold medals going to only China.
For the past decade, many Singaporeans have voiced their concerns that they are not proud of these new citizens who are perceived as only mercenaries, and that the Singapore Government bought these medals using foreign imports. It is also widely known that Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu are not able to converse in English, and has always answered media questions in Mandarin.

29,"Singapore’s public transport conglomerate which own Singapore Bus Service (SBS), ComfortDelgo, has posted a record S$67.6 million profit in the three months ended March. This result is 5% better than the same quarter a year ago.
The record profit posted is built by higher revenue from public buses, public trains and taxis. Train ridership for the North-East line increased by 5.2% to 526,000 rides per day while the new Downtown Line 1, Punggol LRT ridership grew by a whopping 24.1% to 67,000 and Sengkang LRT ridership grew by 13.3% to 95,000 rides a day. ComfortDelgro said they expect revenue to rise further following the rise in ridership and public transport fares.
In April 5 last month, the Singapore Government approved a 2 to 5% increase in public fare.

30,"In the latest interview with Channel News Asia, celebration for SG50 was initially budgeted at $5 million to fund 260 projects led by “Singaporeans”. Each project would be evaluated and the successful ones will have 90% of their expenditures, capped at $50,000, subsidized by the Singapore Government.
Screenshot from YouTube
However, the Singapore Government approved more than 260 projects bringing the total up to 330 projects resulting in an over-budget of $4 million totaling up to $9 million. The Singapore Government do not intend to stop at $9 million though, this is what Minister Lawrence Wong said:
“As there are more ground-up projects that have come forward, we are now setting aside S$9 million to support these projects. From now to August, I believe there will be more applicants because we are still seeing more interest. So I’m quite sure we will go beyond 330 and additional projects may need more support. If need be, we’ll put in additional budget to support that.”

What do you think of Minister Lawrence Wong’s poor budgeting? Do you think the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew would approve spending so much money on this “celebration”?
Below is an eulogy of Mr Lee Kuan Yew by former Minister Sidek Saniff:
“Second question: “You have an overcoat?” I think he knew that people may not use overcoats frequently. I said: “I’ll buy one.”
He said: “No need, Don’t waste money.” He paused for a while and said: “Ahmad Mattar has a good overcoat. Borrow from him.”
Third question: “Do you have the boots to cover your shoes?” This time, I tried to convince him that I could buy the boots myself because they would cost me at most $100.
But he said: “Oh, don’t waste money, don’t waste money.”
He was very thrifty. That was how he handled our money, our kitty. That thrift must start from you. That was his clear message.”

He also did not respect the judicial process and took the law into his own hands.
Nobody, not even a grassroots leader should condone his actions. His actions should be condemned even more than Amos’ actions because this guy is no teenager. He is a 49 year old business owner and he acted like a brute outside the State Courts.
Don’t you agree that Amos Yee’s case has shown that fanaticism overwhelms morality sometimes? Was Neo just being an ‘elder brother’ like what the grassroots leader has said?

33,"A new Executive Condominium (EC) project in Jurong West, the Westwood Residences, will be open for booking with prices up to 6% cheaper than a nearby EC project launched 6 months ago in November 2014. The Westwood Residences have an indicative price of S$800 per square foot (psf) compared to its newly launched neighbour, the Lake Life EC, which started with S$850 psf last year.
Photo from newlaunchesreview.com
Mr Francis Koh, group CEO of one of the Westwood Residences’s developers, Koh Brothers Group:
“We have to consider the market. When compared to the nearby executive condo, what will buyers think of our condo? So we have to price it very competitively.”
According to the latest statistics by Singapore Real Estate Exchange (SRX), EC units in non-central locations like Jurong West see falling rental by as much as 11.2% as compared with its peak in January 2013. Rental volume has also fallen by 11.9% between March and April this year.
According to Bloomberg, listed property firms in Singapore faced a combined total debt of S$23.5 billion that is due on 30th June 2015. As the key Singapore Interbank Offered Rate breached its 1% mark in March this year, mortgage interest rate in Singapore will likely rise resulting in a double whammy to condominium developers in Singapore. This perhaps best explains why Westwood Residences is going at a 6% discount.

“Honestly, TODAY, you are just embarrassing yourself.

The world is reporting this event framed within the constructs of freedom of speech and heavy handed state sanctioned persecution of constitutionalised freedoms.
And here you are, pathetically trying to get his grandma to vilify him.
You should be totally ashamed of your utter lack of journalistic integrity. I thought it was bad enough that the press has been misquoting him but its reporters like you that seem hell bent on dragging the already low ranking of 153 to new abysses.
Yvonne, I hope you will one day look back at your sorry excuse of a career and realise that by writing for the national broadsheet as if it were a trashy tabloid,
you had indeed forged new lows for your craft.

Someone who is *out to deceive a prospective employer*. No one sends a credit card number to get a degree in 10 minutes, without being fully aware of what they’re doing.
It’s entirely different from someone who actually paid $300,000 for a degree course, studied to earn it, and is simply unfortunate that said degree isn’t recognized.
Photo from Chronicle.com
If you’re a hiring manager, you need to distinguish between the two. There is a BIG difference.
If someone has a degree from a valid institution, but it is unaccredited, then by all means proceed to judge based on experience and apparent competence.
But if you meet someone with a degree that came from a mill, then you are *dealing with someone who came to the interview intending to rip you off*. You should feel insulted, because it explains how stupid and ignorant they think you are. So don’t hire them.
But okay, let’s say you don’t have the capacity to judge.
You don’t know what’s a degree mill and what’s not, and you don’t have the inclination to check despite *this actually being your job*.
Let’s say it’s only a few years down the road, when someone else informs you that your employee bought a degree.
Now, even if you’ve found out after the fact, you know what you should do? FIRE THEIR SORRY ASS ANYWAY.
It still matters that, at the time they came to you for the interview, they knowingly downloaded a fake degree in order to perpetrate a form of deceit (see above: NO ONE downloads and presents a fake degree by accident).
Don’t hire people who present degrees from mills, and even if you find out afterward, fire them anyway. They are liars.

How would we know if they are not just lying that an issue or concern is unique? Are we supposed to wait around for the glass with obviously low QC standards to crack mysteriously one day and endangering our children and our lives? Are we supposed to wait past one year when obviously all low quality finishes start to break down and they shift the responsibilities to hdb?
Geraldine Tan-Wee: Our DBSS estate also has its fair share of crappy fittings. Imagine being told by our developer that our kitchen cabinets can’t withstand heat and moisture. These people don’t know how to cook or what? How can the materials used for kitchen cabinets not tahan heat and moisture? Also Meyer told my neighbours that the space btw the cabinet and the cooker hood is too little which is why the hoods break down easily. And my neighbours with engineered timber flooring who don’t use wet wipes or wet mops on them, see the flooring turn black anyway. Some neighbours have had windows that shattered or window seals that cracked so badly when it rains, the rain leaks into their homes.
The worse thing is the way the developer and HDB taichi the issues & our MP and RC was of no help. The RC was bound by red tape to support the views of their grassroots advisor and pls remember they are under PA. You are naive if you think your RC will act like an independent estate committee similar to a condo. Don’t make our mistake. Some of our own committee joined the RC only to realize it didn’t get things resolved. :p Until now, we are told the RC is the proper channel to do things but our RC members have become blind and deaf with time & red tape so our problems haven’t been properly resolved.
Whoever allowed our flats to get to this state should be answerable to the public. How come there were no checks and balances to make sure that proper QC was done before TOP? Just because it is a DBSS apartment, suka suka we are told it is not HDB and is private so we need to get the developer to step in & when it suits the authorities, that it is HDB so too bad. It’s utterly frustrating. Where is that bloody DBSS review outcome that KBW said was being undertaken? How come these developers are getting away with their dishonesty and lies?

37,"A 22 year old Young PAP member serving in Aljunied, Mr Lim Kun Yun aka Edison David Lim has allegedly cheated Mr Gary Liu of $24,380. According to Mr Liu, Mr Lim goes around getting people to invest in his company, collecting investments and instead of accounting for the money he collected in his company’s name, he embezzled the company funds to pay off his personal debts of more than $75,000. Even though Mr Lim is still saddled with all these debts, he is still splurging on his extravagant lifestyle, renting offices that he cannot pay for, and even rented a condo for himself and his staffs to stay in. He also splurged on expensive meals and taxi rides. Mr Liu said that Mr Lim goes around swindling people’s money to sustain his lavish lifestyle.
Mr Lim had reportedly told his parents and everyone else that he is a second lieutenant in his camp, even though he is just a lowly admin NSF. He would also go around asking people to google him for all his achievements in Nanyang Polytechnic (He claims he is a speaker and head of Entreprenuer Club). He also frequently bragged about his links and connections to the PAP (See his FB photos). He also boasted that he owns a condominium, fully paid up (In reality, he rented it).
Till date, according to Mr Liu, the amount he owes Mr Liu and a few other partners and people who loaned him money, adds up to at least a whopping $120,000. This is not inclusive of the outstanding salaries that he owes his staff who are mostly teenage girls. Mr Liu also alleged that Mr Lim offered the staff a salary of $3K to $5K and yet no real work is being done by the staff, because his projects to most of his clients are not even being done. Mr Liu called Mr Lim a ‘lonely and desperate fucker’ who is ‘using loaned money to pay for the girls’ company and attention, to keep them by his side at all times’.
In just a short span of a month, Mr Lim has allegedly squandered about $30,000 on the rental of his condo, to house the girls, to cloth them and feed them, sustaining their lifestyle habits of manicures and more, just so that he would not be alone.
Mr Liu claimed that he has a recording of Mr Lim confessing that he needs the loans to repay his outstanding debts. When the others who loaned Mr Lim money threatened to expose his actions, based on Mr Liu’s Facebook post, he alleged that Mr Lim went to the banks to get a loan, and eventually confessed that he faked and doctored his Notice of Assessment to try and submit a doctored N.O.A. statement which the banks did not detect.
Mr Liu ended his post, stating that he will be making a police report against the errant YPAP member for  all the criminal offences he has committed, namely Criminal Breach of Trust, embezzlement of company funds, doctoring of Legal Documents, cheating the banks and owing staff salaries and refusing to pay.
Mr Lim was an active Young PAP member, and even had photos with former Minister and former PAP chairman, Mr Lim Boon Heng. As of now, there is no response from the Young PAP about the serious misconduct demonstrated by their member.

38,"Tabloids are fascinating creatures of habit. They stalk, they harass and they gobble up almost anything you give them. Today, this was exactly what happened when Amos Yee alleged that he was molested by his bailor, Vincent Law—they gobbled it up, hook, line and sinker.
It is a sad state of affairs when reporters are willing to pick up almost any allegation, no matter how baseless, and no matter the context in which it is made. It does get you viewers, and you may arguably have a responsibility to report on things which are “newsy”, but is it right?
Is it right to spread a false allegation that impugns the integrity of a respected youth counsellor, not to mention the integrity of your own newspaper?
Is it right to make no distinction between allegations that come from reliable sources and are corroborated by evidence, and allegations that are made with the explicit intention of manipulating the mainstream media?
So what did Yee really say, and what was the context of his allegation?
Screenshot from Facebook
Amos made this allegation in a Facebook post wherein he complained of reporters harassing him. They had “gathered at my doorstep, wanting some exclusive interviews and some photos,” leading Yee to tell them to “fuck off”.
Yee’s attitude then changed and the rest of his Facebook post is written in a sarcastic tone. He said, “But then after awhile, I started to contemplate, is this really.... The right approach in dealing with the mass media? And then I realized... no... it isn’t. It really isn’t.”
When Yee said that “it” wasn’t the right approach to dealing with the media, he didn’t mean that chasing them away was wrong per se. He meant that his strategy for chasing them away by telling them to “fuck off” wasn’t working and he needed to alter it a little.
He couldn’t possibly have wanted to reward the mainstream media, which he called, “tabloid creating cunts”, with an important piece of news.
When he said “you are diligent, and I have to say... I admire that,” it was with a strong sense of irony. After all, their diligence had consisted of chasing down his friends, family, and even the Catholic Church in the hopes that they might find something juicy to say about his personal life.
Is he antisocial and psychologically unsound? Is he on bad terms with his own mother? Did he get kicked out by his own Catholic Church? These were all allegations that the mainstream media made against him, and it was indeed diligent of them to have dug up so much.
Yee wasn’t endorsing any of this; it would take a lot of hubris to think he would endorse his own character assassination. He was playing on the mainstream media’s lack of respect for the truth.
Hence with the same irony that pervades his entire post, he wrote, “you have the responsibility towards the general public to provide news, you deserve information, and regardless of the risk that you guys will misquote me, you deserve the truth.”
On the face of things, this statement seems to indicate a high opinion of the media. But if we think about what he has gone through at their hands, and how he calls them “tabloid creating cunts”, I do not think things are as they seem. What this really means, I think, is that Yee is giving them the “news” they want, the “information” they deserve, and the “truth” that they have sought after so long and hard even if it meant misquoting his mother or various other parties.
So, with little of the sense of shame that molestation victims frequently experience, Yee boldly declared, “I’ll even reveal that little tidbit of information on how my ex-bailor, Vincent Law, molested me.” What? A “little tidbit of information”?  Such a flippant attitude towards being molested is rarely exhibited by victims of sexual abuse. Surely this would have been a tell-tale sign that the allegation isn’t true.
Nonetheless, the mainstream media all ran stories repeating the allegation. Who cares if the mere fact of an allegation would impugn the reputation of a respected youth counsellor, and possibly threaten his livelihood, seeing as how he deals with teenagers frequently in personal settings? An irresponsible approach that ignores such questions is unethical.
Journalists have a duty to consider not just whether a piece of news is “newsy”, they must also consider whether their publicising of the allegation will hurt a person’s reputation, and whether they are attempting to satisfy a prurient interest or a legitimate public interest. Would they do the same of Gopalan Nair’s allegation that Law Minister K. Shanmugam had a sordid affair? Clearly not. So why do so here?
Till now, there has been no evidence that Yee was indeed molested apart from that lone statement made in the context of a Facebook post which sought to punish the media with a “little tidbit” of false information. Vincent Law, the youth counsellor, has flat-out denied this allegation. Yee’s own lawyers were taken by surprise
In the same way that The Real Singapore was held responsible for repeating false allegations, even if the allegations were made by their sources and not themselves, perhaps the mainstream media should bear some responsibility if this allegation does in fact turn out to be absolutely untrue.
Then again, it might be true that Yee was molested. That is the beauty of a false allegation right? It creates doubt; and no doubt many a parent will now have second thoughts about having their child continue to work with Mr Law.
If Yee made a false allegation, he is a 16-year-old who cried wolf. But if the media that we rely on for accurate news repeats that false allegation, we sow doubt in the minds of 5 million people and we tear the reputation of one youth counsellor to shreds. This, surely, cannot be right.
UPDATE: In another Facebook post, Amos Yee says “Vincent Law didn’t really molest me”. He only said it to “make use of the voracious desire of the reporters, to f**k with the mainstream media.” He explains that “it was all a troll, a troll that can only be possible by the inherent stupidity of the media.”

39,"What really transpired between the Ministry of National Development (MND) and the Workers’ Party Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol-East Town Council (AHPETC)? Recently we see the Singapore Government MND throwing a lot of sensational accusations at AHPETC, like “technically insolvent” and “failed to take up the offer by MND”. You have been hearing a lot of stories from the 154th ranking Singapore mainstream media, the timeline below will be the uncensored truth of what really happened:
August 2011 – Shortly after winning Aljunied GRC, the PAP-owned Action Information Management (AIM) company terminated the usage of their financial software to the Workers’ Party. The former Aljunied PAP team was also uncooperative resulting many wasted months for the WP’s auditor to audit past funds. This is the story that led to the mess of AHPETC’s finance. Read more from here.
28th April 2014 – MND wrote to AHPETC:
“MND is considering to withhold the FY14/15 S&CC Operating Grant until the conclusion of the audit by the Auditor-General. Right now, we do not have reasonable assurance of proper financial management and keeping of accounts by AHPETC. Before we do so, we want to know whether AHPETC has any views or concerns as regards the proposed withholding of the above S&CC Operating Grant. If there are, you must let us have AHPETC’s views or concerns in writing for our consideration no later than 10 working days after you have received this letter (i.e. by May 14, 2014).”
MND did not receive a reply, but proceeded to withhold the government grant to AHPETC.
16th June 2014 – MND continued to withhold government grant, and AHPETC wrote to MND explaining how disruptive MND has been to AHPETC’s cash flow:
“the continued withholding of the grant to AHPETC is likely to critically and adversely affect the TC’s cash flow position, resulting in a disruption of essential services to the town because the TC would not be able to pay its contractors...We call on the Ministry to disburse without further delay the Operating Grant it has withheld from AHPETC.”
20th June 2014 – MND said to AHPETC
“MND may reconsider the withholding of grant, to take into account the impact, if any, this may have on the TC’s provision of essential services to the town.”
Talks went on for months, but MND remains unsatisfied and refused to release any grant despite AHPETC’s best effort to explain their cash flow position.
7th October 2014 – MND said:
“MND is deeply concerned about the TC’s financial situation based on the information you provided and we would like to work with you to see how we can help the TC sustain its operations and avoid disruption of essential services to residents. We are prepared to consider, as an exceptional measure, releasing half the operating grant to AHPETC while the AGO audit is still on-going”
However MND did nothing and continued to withhold the government grants, faulting AHPETC for “not replying”. This contradict with MND’s earlier behaviour of proceeding to act without getting a reply on 28th April 2014 (scroll up).
12th November 2014 – AHPETC informed MND they are ready to receive half the operating grant. MND continued to withhold grant for no reason despite saying they will consider giving out half the grant earlier.
9th February 2014 – AGO’s report found no corruption from AHPETC’s finances. MND continued to withhold grant for no reason, despite claiming so to “wait for the AGO report”.
Today – AHPETC could not fulfill the law requirement of making quarterly transfers to its sinking fund because MND continues to withhold its fund for no reason.
Do you think MND is deliberately being unruly here?

I should issue a sincere apology to Vincent Law? Hahahahaha.
It once again is alarmingly indicative of the inherent stupidity of our species to immediately formulate a stance, with a complete lack of evidence, and say it with such conviction. That is of course the mindset inherent in that of religion. I’m still really skeptical of my Christian fans by the way, you’re supposed to damn me (Mark 3:29) yet you hold me a vigil.
Now the preconceived notion portrayed on the media towards Vincent is simply that he put himself in the line of fire, he assisted me by putting up $20000, and allowed a rebellious 17-year-old boy to be able to come out of prison, and attain his freedom. He is a generous, kind-hearted Christian, caring and with lots of love.
So now, when I made allegations that he molested me, people would then start blaming me. This person helped you Amos, he risked his reputation and his own money for you, and yet you accuse him of molestation.
So now, let me reveal the inherent fallacy in even attempting to make a definitive claim towards my allegation, the fact that nobody but me(At least until you finish reading this blog post), knows what Vincent did, during the one-and-a-half weeks that he was my bailer.
The media that my fans so boldly criticized when I was maligned, and now you fall prey to it, just because it’s not TheStraitsTimes that’s doing it anymore, but TheOnlineCitizen. This is what happens when you decide to make your decisions based on biasness and sticking to your side, instead of actual logic, even Roy Ngerng seems to be guilty of that, saying ‘oh my gosh, it’s going to be so hard for us to advocate for you, now that you’ve humiliated Vincent’.
So let me tell you, if my fanbase consists of hypocrites, then despite your support I wouldn’t want it. When things looks bad, and you threaten to remove the support you once had for me. Then fine, good riddance. If that’s the kind of support I receive, one that’s so easily withdrawn, then believe me, I do not wish to acquire your quote unquote ‘support’.
Anyways, I’m sure all of you are reeling in excitement, so let’s get to Vincent.
As you guys know, I’ve experienced a lot over the past couple of months, I got charged, I was sent to jail, I got assaulted in the face. However, I would make the claim, that having Vincent Law as a bailer, is personally, to me, the most unnerving aspect of this whole experience.
And although Vincent didn’t sodomize me physically, he did violate me emotionally, and I am going to reveal how he did that, right now.
Part 1: The incidents that lead to the series of unfortunate events
First, I shall answer the question: Who the fuck is Vincent Law? And how the fuck did he manage to become my bailer?
Well more than 3 days after I was sent to Changi Prison, nobody came up to my parents to offer to be my bailers or assist in finding bailers. I do not blame any of you because the only way you can contact my parents is via their phone number, which obviously majority of the people don’t have, and as of now, they still do not have active Facebook accounts.
However, about 2 days before the court date, a lad by the name of Jonovan, whom my mom and I had met in a little activist get-together, came along and said that there were 3 people who were willing to be my bailers, and he would pick the best one to do so.
A day before the court, my mother was then introduced to Vincent, and Jonovan said that this was the person who was going to be my bailer, and my mother accepted it. My mother completely trusted Jonovan and did not bother to meet up the other people who offered to be bailers or question the criteria of Jonovan’s choice.
In view of the bail officer, my mother, stupidly trusting Jonovan’s choice, consented. And my father, without even meeting Vincent at all until that moment, being the blur dumb fuck that he is, simply consented, not at all fearful that the bailer that he got for his son might be a raving lunatic. This is of course representative of him being the negligent parent, which is why he has offered close to no assistance to my mother in terms of parenting for the past 10 years, and is languishing alone in the house we have at Jurong.
So my parents, and the bailing officer, whom did not attain my consent at all, allowed Vincent to be my bailer.
Afterwards, I found out that there were an additional 4 people during the court day, some of whom I had known, and all of whom I would have definitely preferred to be my bailers, whom were willing to bail me. However, for a reason completely unknown to me, 2 of them didn’t say anything, and the other 2 revealed their willingness to be my bailer only during the time when the bail was already being processed.
After I was released at the bail center, I immediately had dinner with Jonovan and he shared with me the reason why he chose this stranger to be my bailer. He gave several reasons like the fact that he was mostly unknown, comparatively to other people, his reputation least likely to be stained if he were to be associated with me, he wasn’t political, so people would not accuse me of collaborating political party to further their political goals (Which really isn’t necessarily a bad thing).
Basically, unlike me who would have played a little more creatively with the concept of the bailer-bailee relationship, Jonovan made thethe most boring choice,because he thought it was the most ‘strategic.
However, I think that the variable that Jonovan probably did not consider, which was the most important one, at least to me, was whether or not the bailer would be an asshole.
Though maybe Jonovan did, and like so many others, maybe Vincent manipulated Jonovan into thinking that he would be the nicest bailer out of those 3 people, but seeing what Vincent did to me, I am extremely skeptical of that.
Maybe in the near future, Jonovan might wish to clarify further the aspects he considered when he his decision. But currently, as of now, I feel compelled to say, fuck you Jonovan.
It’s a rare circumstance where there are several people who are willing to be bailers, and unfortunately there was no distinct avenue for bailer auditions.
So in a moment of miscommunication, ignorance and confusion, what I ended up with as a bailer, was Vincent Law.
Part 2: The Molestation
Once I went out of the bail center, I saw my family, Vincent and some other friends, and the first thing that Vincent said to me was:
‘Hello, I am Vincent your bailer. I think the first thing you should know about me is that I’m a Christian’
And I responded with a resounding ‘Oh fuck..’
And he replied: ‘Yes, so deal with it!’
He then said that he had something on in the evening, and would meet me tomorrow before I went to see the lawyers, which I agreed on.
The initial gut feeling was that Vincent was an absolute fucking asshole, but I was never a person to judge someone based on first impressions, they’re never fully accurate (Though in this case it was). And yeah he was a Christian, but I could work around that, why not? Not all religious people are vicious cunts, all my good friends from Secondary School are Buddhist, so regardless of absolutely abhorring their religious views, I can still like and interact with them.
The next day, we met up at a coffee shop and instituted the appropriate introductions and our first conversation. He asked about my background, my interests and my intentions in lieu of my charges which I readily provided to him.
The first few minutes that I talked to him, he seemed like a relatively harmless person, serviceable, but bland, nothing particularly special about him, no truly interesting or provocative views or delivery, been there done that.
But as we went along, Vincent then decided to discuss with about religion. And from there the meat-headed conservatism commonly upheld by fundamentalist Christians, soon emerged.
He tried to explain why he practiced the fate, the supposed tenants of Christianity, what the advocates of Jesus are. And his points, like every theist who tries to validate their religion, was absolutely baseless and horrible.
So I responded with the usual Atheist arguments of there’s absolutely no evidence at all that Jesus existed, the false sense of hope created by religion impedes one to more effectively solve personal problems and thus impedes the betterment of oneself, Christianity is responsible for several generations of violence and still is responsible for causing turmoil and fear to adherents alike, you know the common, simple basic refutations of religion.
Then he just sat there, face stern, chest upwards, with the air of a hot-headed bull, and then said to me:
Oh well since I’m a Christian,and you don’t like religion, then I guess you don’t like me, so maybe I should just discharge myself as your bailer!’
Wow...... What the fuck? That seemed a little uncalled for.. What’s up with the threat?
So I calmed him down and said it’s all cool, just because someone disagrees with a person’s views, doesn’t mean that they think the person is bad, nor does it mean you have to hate him for it.
So he became calm and cool and we continued a peaceful conversation, we met the lawyers, had lunch and then I left for home.
But needless to say, I already did not like him.
The next day, he did not contact me. However the following day, during the evening, he called my number and told me that the directors of Public Enemy invited me to their play, and Vincent wanted me to accept the invitation, he also requested a meet-up with me tomorrow after I had seen IO Jason chua. However, I wasn’t in the mood, and declined the invitation.
You know, because I’m an introverted teenager and I wanted some time alone for myself, I wanted to write the 10 posts that I was going to use to breach the terms of the bail, I wanted to complete the 5th dungeon of Bowser’s Inside Story, and I wanted to catch up on season 5 of Game Of Thrones.
So because of those reasons and also the fact that I’d already started to dislike talking to him I expressed displeasure with wanting to meet with him the following day or attend the play, admittedly a little vehemently, and urged him to perhaps provide me a little space and postpone our meeting to a date where I was more enthusiastic in indulging in a social get-together.
And ever since then, the shit fucking happened.
He then shouted on the phone, ‘How dare you refuse a meeting with your bailer! This is unacceptable! I have a responsibility as a bailer! I am going to discharge myself!’
Wow, wow what?! Don’t discharge yourself. What the fuck?! Hi wow, it’s not fucking funny, a person might have to go back to prison because of that!
’24 hours! I gave you more than 24 hours! You should be thankful! I have responsibilities as a bailer!’
So I offered some conciliatory words and said ‘ok ok fine’ I’ll meet you, and to further placate him and ensure he didn’t discharge himself, I also said I would attend the play (Yeah, I never wanted to go to the play, it was in a state of fear which is why I ended up going, sorry Alfian)
And just from that simple refusal of one request, that I eventually acceded to, he said:
‘Initially I had intended to give you your space and only meet up once a week. But now, seeing how you refused a simple meet-up with your bailer. I now want to meet you, every day’
And ever since then, he demanded, without fail, for me to meet up with him, every day.
For 9 days, I had to go from Bishan, , all the way to City Hall, Orchard or his house at Clementi, to meet up with him for 2-3 hours. There was no important issue to discuss about, any information I needed to provide to him in lieu of the lawyers or my court case, he just demanded to meet up with him every day with absolutely no good reason whatsoever.
A daily meeting with meeting with Vincent would go like this: We would sit and he would ask a question, and I would issue a really short response.Then there will be these really long pauses in between sentences as Vincent desperately tries to find another topic to ease the awkwardness, it was simply unbearable.
And every day I would constantly say to him ‘I do not like these meetings,can we please stop having so many meetings and just have them once a week? You know I don’t like these meet-ups, so why do you keep on doing this?’
And one day he replied, and believe me, I am not lieing, he said:
‘I know that you do not like these meetings Amos. And I am doing this, because I like to piss you off.’
It’s amazing how a sadist can manipulate others into thinking he’s a kind and generous person, maybe that’s what he meant when he said when he was a follower of Jesus.
I also asked:
‘Don’t you think it would be better if a relationship is 2-sided? Don’t you feel like our conversation would be more productive and fulfilling it if I don’t go in reluctantly.’
And he replied:
‘No no it’s fine Amos, looking at your behavior now, I already like to see and talk to you Amos. You are exciting and fascinating to me’
Wow... I can see how he manages to turn his wife on in bed.
On several occasions, he would initiate another theological debate and then when his argument was being torn down, he would threaten to discharge himself as my bailer.
And whenever I expressed further displeasure and reluctance on meeting him every day, he would then, once again, threaten to discharge himself as my bailer.
One time, my mother accompanied me to meet with Dodwell (My lawyer), to write my affidavit. After meeting the lawyer, Vincent with his continued insistence of his daily meetings, told me to see him in City Hall at 5:30pm. However, the meet-up with Dodwell stretched on for much longer than we initially expected, and I definitely couldn’t make it to City Hall on time.
So my mother decided that since I couldn’t make it on time, and since Dodwell wanted to me to further assist him on the preparation of the bail review, she would urge Vincent to cancel the meet-ups for a few days.
She texted Vincent:
‘Alfred needs Amos to do quite a lot of stuffs today n tmr. Can the meetings be cancelled till Thursday?’
And he replied word for word, and I quote:
‘He’s hiding behind your back. If you back hi now... I’d defer to u. U decide.’
How the hell am I hiding behind my mother’s back? I’m right beside her in the lawyer’s office.
And since then, my mother too was introduced to Vincent Law’s insanity.
One time because I accidentally forgot to charge my phone for the night, I went out with a power-less phone.
My mother had followed me to meet with IO Jason Chua that morning, and apparently Vincent, who called me more than 7 times prior, contacted my mother expressing that he’ll discharge himself, who then passed me her phone. And once again I was inflicted with Vincent’s incessant shouting:
‘It is your responsibility Amos to charge your phone at night! It is your responsibility to be contactable at all times! I am your bailer and I need to be able to contact you!’
I said sorry, sorry, I’ll immediately charge my phone once it gets back as he continued belching his lecture on responsibility.
And from that one accident, he demanded that I had to call him every morning at 8am, I expressed displeasure and reluctance in doing so however he said that if I didn’t, he would discharge himself as my bailer(Yeah it was really that repetitive).
Another instance, Vincent even started whining to me in a shrieking voice and said, ‘You know how many hate messages I have gotten once I became your bailer! You know how many people have criticized me on Facebook? You better appreciate what I’m doing for you!’
Buddy, you’re the one who went up and said you wanted to be my bailer, now that it’s not going favorably for you ,that’s your fucking problem not mine, I’m not going to be sympathetic to any of your whining. And I do not appreciate a fucking thing that you did, no matter how much you want it. Appreciation is earned, not demanded.
And another day at his house, he told me:
‘Hi I just watched the video you made last time. The ‘My lost love’ one. I think it would be really great if you and I could get together with that girl you had a crush on, and then perhaps I can interview her.’
And by this point I was just rendered speechless.
Keep in mind, this is a youth counsellor, this is a person is that is said to have an understanding of youths. People who possess this quality of understanding, is allowed to attain a certification in Singapore, to become counsellors and psychiatrists. So now you see the reason why I did not continue my sessions at IMH.
Furthermore, Vincent imposed the rule, that I am never allowed to take pictures with anyone while he was my bailer
Now seeing the wide gamut of said bail condition (Not to post, upload, or otherwise distribute any comment or content, whether directly or indirectly, to any social media or online service or website, while the current case is ongoing) , if someone took photos with me, I technically would have breached the bail condition. But I never got caught for that, just like I never got caught when I liked Facebook posts.
If anyone ever requested to take a picture with me, I had always obliged, they get to post it on Instagram, it possibly makes their day, and I feel happy.
If something was against the rules but it was harmless, and I enjoyed it and I never got caught, I and everyone else would continue doing it. It’s kind of like the law against piracy. It’s there, but we all still use torrent.
So whenever Vincent wasn’t around, I still took pictures with fans when they wanted it. But whenever he was, my gosh...
Some fellow background actors after their performance in Public Enemy (Which was by the way absolutely horrible) wanted to take a couple of pictures with me. Then I said yeah sure, it’s all good fun.
However Vincent disagreed, and then started to make this huge scene just outside the entrance, and there were several witnesses, Roy Ngerng was there. Vincent stood at the center, incessantly pointing his index finger at my face and proclaiming ‘It’s your responsibility Amos! It’s your responsibility if you take pictures with other people! I don’t want you to break the terms of the bail! I have responsibilities as a bailer!’
And I just stood there flabbergasted and embarrassed, trying to placate him, just wishing that he would stop.
And because those background actors were non-questioning, conformist amateurs, the type who blindly follows everything that they are told (Which probably explains the quality of their performance), they nodded subserviently to Vincent and were like:
‘ Oh yeah yeah yeah.. we don’t want to give trouble to all of you, we don’t want to give trouble to anyone’
Seeing how angry and riled up Vincent gets whenever somebody wishes to take a picture of me, I kind of have this really weird vibe, and I hope it doesn’t seem overt to say this, but it seems as though he’s jealous that I am getting attention. Well I am the guy who went to prison for an internet video, so I think some people would be interested.
Come on Vincent, you no gotta be jealous, the one that has fame isn’t necessarily better, if you want fame and attention so much then go make your own viral video dude, don’t vent all your frustrations on me.
The turmoil of meeting Vincent Law daily, was excruciating, it felt as though I’m stuck with this mentally unsound person, obligated to act as one of those central aspects of his life to make him feel less lonely.
However, as the days went by, I became more accustomed to the scenario, and thought of a way, to perhaps use the circumstance to my advantage.
I knew that I was obligated to meet him every day, and I couldn’t escape it. So instead of being all namby-pamby pussy, acting all vulnerable and weak, why not I turn the tables around, and let me be the bad guy, and instead of him fucking me, I fuck him.
What frightens a mental psychotic, is another mental psychotic. I had to become more insane than Vincent. He knew that I did not like meeting him. So I turned it around, and made his meetings with me as painful for him as possible.
He wanted to talk to me, so I did. I constantly criticized him, insulted his career choice, and continued to engage in theological debates with him, and blatantly revealed the falsehood and bullshit of every one of his supposedly Christian tenants.
The aspect of the bible that we argued the most about was the infamous bear story, where God chose to summon a bear to maul a group of boys after they made fun of a bald priest.
The verse was from 2 Kings 2:23: ‘some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. “Get out of here, baldy!” they said. “Get out of here, baldy!” 24 He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys’
I of course said that this was quite evident that God was a mass murderer. And he refuted that claim, and I’m not even joking, it really is that stupid, and it really provided me further insight to the extent of just how delusional a religious person can be, and he said:
‘the verse says that some boys came out of the town. But then in the end they said that 42 boys were mauled by a bear. Since before they only said some boys, there could have been more than 42 boys initially. There could have been 100, there could have been 200, therefore once some of the boys saw the bear, they might have ran away, they might have took. Therefore since it is so vague, this verse is open to interpretation, therefore it can be argued that God did not actually summon those bears and killed those children for making fun of that bald priest, therefore he is not a mass-murderer!’
Wow....Wow....... Just.... Wow........
I had to push my limits and frequently curb my anger at witnessing how someone can be inane to such an extent, not revealing at all that I felt vulnerable, and continued to remain measured and refute him with logic. Every time I would leave the meetings with a sore throat. I continued to talk to him, and talk to him good because I knew I had turned the tables around, he was the vulnerable one, not me, and now I am the one that is fucking with him.
And whenever he threatened to discharge himself again (I counted 9 times), I would disingenuously pacify him and be all like:
‘Dude, it’s all cool man, chill man, peace dude’ (I started to talk like a hippy)
I would manipulate him into thinking that we are experiencing hostility between us, but this is the process that will lead us into forging an everlasting friendship. And being the sociopathic dumbass that he was, he actually bought it.
He was convinced to such an extent, that just for a short moment, Vincent might even have thought that he was forging a genuine relationship, that I had reciprocated (Hah!). He felt so comfortable with me, that he even revealed a little vulnerable side of him, about the neglect that he had with his father when he was a child.
However, that still did not at all curb the absolute anger and turmoil that I had to face while engaging in 9 days of conversation with him, and also doesn’t discount the fact that while he was sharing his little melancholic story about how he would always look out the window at night to see if his father had reached home, I really did not give a fuck.
And by that time, just one day before the court, I had finished writing, I was going to breach the terms of the bail.
Part 3: Beyond the valley of Vincent’s sodomy
In the morning at around 4:30am, I breached the terms of the bail, posted 10 posts online, and from that, I was free. I did not have to follow any of Vincent’s rules anymore, I did not have to meet up with, I did not have to speak to him ever again, I was free.
Why I didn’t do it earlier and reduced the torment that I had to endure from Vincent? It was simply the fact that I wasn’t finished yet. IO Jason Chua and molester Vincent really took up a lot of time during those days.
Fucking enraged that I had broken the terms of the bail, and that he had been ineffectual bailer, when I was going to meet up with the lawyers just before court, Vincent would constantly call me, which I ignored, and spam messages on my phone like ‘traitor’, ‘liar’, ‘you can’t be trusted’.
Such biting words, I feel the guilt coursing through my veins.
And during the PTC when I was outside of court, discussing with Dodwell whether or not to compromise to the demands of the prosecutor concerning the terms of my bail. Vincent, who laughably with the impression that I had still wanted to continue having him as a bailer, told me ‘If I am to continue being your bailer, I am going to impose a new set of rules, and you have to follow them’
And since I had already broken the terms of the bail and did not have to suck up to him so that he would continue being my bailer, I obviously replied with a resounding ‘fuck no’.
And after that, seeing how in front of the judge, he discharged himself with such immediacy, was just so revealing.
Before I entered Changi Prison I told my mother and several of my activist buddies, that I absolutely hated Vincent and hope to not ever associate with him ever again in the future. And when I came out of Changi Prison, I found out that they did convey that message to him.
However, he, not respecting my decisions at all, insisted on adamantly jutting himself into other people’s personal life when nobody wanted him.
He went to most of my court hearings when I was shackled, he was the first few people I saw the instance I went out of prison and came out of the bail center (Oh the horror).
He even signed all the forms to visit me in Prison , though he couldn’t visit me because it takes 2 weeks to process those forms and before that I was already out(Otherwise I would probably be the only person in Changi Prison history to refuse a face-to-face visit).
And if any of you out there who had the opportunity to see me during the few times I was at court, handcuffed and chained, particularly during the bail review, you might have noticed that whenever I was unfortunate enough to slip into the horrid realms of Vincent’s eye contact, I would respond by flipping him the sanctimonious finger.
So when I was in Changi Prison, I had already intended to publicly humiliate Vincent. The initial idea was to have a really large party celebrating my release, inviting as many activists, politicians and people as possible, and also invite Vincent too. And then afterwards I will give a speech which turns out to be a vicious admonishment and reveal of the torture that Vincent had inflicted on me. Vincent would then stand there mouth agape, if he in a moment of fury, leaped onto me and started punching me on the ground, that would have been ever better. Roy Ngerng will film that live footage, give the files to me and I’ll post it on Youtube.
However,when those reporters came to my doorstep and a little morning walk catalyzed the idea of issuing a spectacular troll to the mass media, I felt like I needed that extra spice that would be able to disrupt all the reporters in their work, and have them flooding to Pasir Panjang.
And then it hit me, Vincent Law, youth counsellor molesting Amos Yee. I could achieve 2 goals at once. The amalgamation of those 2 aspects , humiliating Vincent law and trolling the media, was impeccable.
Part 4: A discourse in lieu of child pedophilia
In the presence of other people, as we met up with Roy Ngerng, Vincent’s friends and the creators of Public Enemy (Who were exceptionally nice people. They are horrible as artists, but pretty great as people) they would be fooled by Vincent and deem him as a kind-hearted bailer. He helped children and migrant workers, he treated everyone to food, and because I had to continue sucking up to him because otherwise he would threaten to discharge himself, I had to make him seem like he was the best bailer in the world, in front of everyone.
And whenever Vincent wasn’t around and I tried to express the turmoil I had to endure from meeting Vincent every day, people would all just be like ‘Oh.. This is Vincent’s just doing his job as a bailer, Vincent is just fulfilling his responsibilities as a bailer’
Even my good activist buddy, Shelley, when I told her about the intimidations that Vincent made on me, tried to speak up for her dear friend Vincent and say ‘This might just be one of the counselling techniques that Vincent wanted to use on you’
Wow, his mistreatment and intimidation towards me, is deemed as a ‘counselling technique’, if this is truly one of Vincent’s techniques he uses as a Youth counsellor, then you can see why I would feel absolutely no remorse if he loses his job.
Also concerning his job, I know people are especially angry that I accused him of molestation because he is a youth counsellor, and since he has been accused, parents would not ever want to send their children over to be counselled by him, because I had already sowed doubt.
But even though he didn’t molest me, seeing what he said and the ‘counselling techniques’ he used on me, I think it would be wise for parents to not hire Vincent for their children. Unless you feel that emotional torment is helpful to your child emotional state, though the view of which is unsurprising since that would be the mentality that you hold when you decide to put your children in schools.
The time I had to endure Vincent, I felt like his puppet, a little toy that he could play with. He did not treat me like a person, he treated me like an object, a slave.
First the Government, then my father, and then Vincent, I’m really always getting incessantly victimized aren’t I?
Now you might be asking, why the hell did I accede to his demands? Couldn’t I just change the bailer to someone who wasn’t a dick?
Surprisingly while I was in prison conceptualizing how I was going to breach the terms of the bail again, I never considered the implications of who my bailer was when I eventually breached my bail, but during the time that I was outside, I soon did. I realized that my initial ignorance and Jonovan’s piss-poor decision actually lead to a great person to be the victim when I broke the terms of the bail.
Because initially I had the impression that the bailer’s reputation would be stained if their fellow bailee broke the terms of the bail. If I had a bailer that I liked, I wouldn’t want to do that to them. However if it was an asshole that was my bailer, like Vincent Law, then I would.
He might have to forfeit $20000 (Though if that happened, I would reimburse him), but more importantly, since he often acted as a bailer to other people such as migrant workers, and since I had breached the terms of the bail, his reputation could potentially be stained as a bailer, and he wouldn’t have any opportunities to ever carry out his job.
However because the judge decided to not fully revoke my bail and wanted to ‘give me a 2nd chance’ because I was ‘young’ and ‘immature’, Vincent did not have to forfeit anything and in lieu of his reputation as a person and a bailer, I don’t think it left the adverse effect on him that I had intended, though hopefully the previous accusation of molest and this post does.
And really Vincent being angry about an allegation of molest is just being pissed off by the response created by stupid people. If unlike the mass media one possesses an IQ that was more than 2 digits, one would probably have already guessed right from the start that it was all a troll.(Dick Ow.? Honestly... Dick Ow?)
I’m never affected by the response of stupid people because you should never be intimidated and stop doing what you love, just because many people are against you, especially when those people are fucking idiots. Which is why though I received a voluminous amount of hate mail, a hit in the face, and 18 days of jail, I’m still chugging along, day by day, continuing to produce the iconoclastic content on my Facebook and blog that you guys oh-so-love. And if those asshole policemen return my fucking camera, I can also continue making my videos too 😀
So right now Vincent is hogging my mother , demanding that I issue a public apology to him and his family, otherwise he would get a lawyer to sue me.
And I think that’s pretty clear enough evidence that Vincent Law, is a charlatan, Vincent Law is huckster, he is a hypocrite and he is a fraud.
He’s standing up for me, he’s fighting for freedom of speech, he’s fighting against the laws that claims that even if somebody lies, mocks or offends a person or large amounts of people, it should not be deemed as a criminal offence.
But now, when the cause that he so boldly advocated, is used unfavorably towards him, he is now threatening to use those exact same laws that he went against, to sue me, and yet you all claim that his intentions were genuine.
But let me tell you Vincent, if you do indeed sue me for defamation,then I’ll sue you for emotional abuse of a child. And seeing how I’m already baselessly deemed as a mentally disturbed teenager, I think the judge will look very favorably to my case.
So there you go. Ah hah! How about that bitch!
Oh and also, unbeknownst to me initially, my mother revealed that there is in fact a 2nd definition of the word ‘molest’. With reference to thefreedictionary.com
mo·lest
(mə-lĕst′)
tr.v. mo·lest·ed, mo·lest·ing, mo·lests
1. To disturb, interfere with, or annoy
And after you’ve read this tale you would know that Vincent did in fact disturb and annoy me.
So technically, Vincent didn’t molest me, but yet he did. The beauty of contrarieties in life.
Part 5 : Alas! Me fellow munchkins, we are about to conclude. At yonder Vincent trembles, relish me friends, haha!
My fellow friends, this is what happens when you get a Christian as a bailer.
But regardless of all those horrible things that he did to me, did that warrant a temporary accusation of molestation for 12 hours, that could potentially have ruined his relationship with his family, made him lose his job and his entire livelihood? Well... I thought it did.
Revenge is indeed a dish best served cold. And after my little accusation of molest, all is well and good. It was an ingredient to effectively troll the media, I managed to publicly humiliate Vincent, and after this incident he has decided to wash his hands off me and that means, I will never see or talk to him again (At least I hope).
If anybody was unfortunate enough to have to be obligated to associate with a person such as Vincent, then my gosh, I express my greatest sympathies. The experience was thoroughly traumatic for me I assure you. But like any tumultuous experience in my life, I got over it, and possibly became cooler in the process.
So there you go, I am done Wasn’t that an exciting story? I hope you enjoyed it. And now that I have finished telling the tale, your humble narrator shall depart and engage in another potentially new and exciting endeavor. Now that it has been written, we will go around, brother-in-arms, village to village, laughing, sharing and spreading the tale – of the molestation of Vincent Law. Have fun!

41,"A low profile MP by the name of Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim made it to the headline of government-controlled mainstream media Channel News Asia (CNA) today.
Featuring his Facebook profile, CNA reported how the Nee Soon GRC MP Associate Professor made an “announcement” about how the road expansion at the Central Expressway (CTE), Tampines Expressway (TPE) and Seletar Expressway (SLE) are “on track for completion”.

The road expansion project and works are initiated and managed by the Land Transport Authority. It is understood that MP Faishal did not make any speech in Parliament calling for road expansion before its project commencement in January 2015. Neither does the cost of the road expansion comes out from his own pocket or his Town Council’s.
How is this a piece of news and made it to the headlines is nothing new for the Singapore Government-controlled mainstream media. The 154th ranking in press freedom press would often act as published cheerleaders for the ruling PAP MPs, like as in this case, attributing a stat board-sponsored road expansion project to a PAP MP.
Despite having being in politics for the past 9 years, MP Faishal’s Facebook page is only created recently in February 2014, or 3 years after he won the General Election on the coat tail of the Law Minister K Shanmugam. He first joined politics by being included in an uncontested walkover GRC of Marine Parade during GE2006. In Parliament, he has been very low profile, making no significant contributions worth mentioning in the news.
Do you want MP Faishal as a MP just because he is an Associate Professor?

42,"The Media Development Authority (MDA) has fined cable vision service provider Starhub S$50,000 yesterday (May 15) for a service disruption in 2013. On Sep 28 2013, about 170,000 Starhub Cable Vision (SCV) subscribers across different areas of Singapore see a complete loss of television signal for 5 hours. The cause of the service disruption is a power trip of the switching board which supplied power to its signal transmitters at Starhub’s Ayer Rajah Data Centre.
In a press release, MDA said:
“MDA has determined that the disruption could have been prevented or made less severe if SCV had put in place effective contingency measures to deal with the power surge, such that the back-up system would not have been overloaded”
Photo from MDA website
As for determining the penalty fine amount, MDA claimed that it considered factors like Starhub’s service recovery option and goodwill measures Starhub implemented to make up for the service disruption.
However what is more notable is the time taken for MDA to issue the fine. The fine was only finalized and effected yesterday in 2015 – for a service disruption which occurred nearly 2 years ago. What is the purpose of a penalty 2 year late and how would it constitute a deterrence to other companies?
A few weeks ago on April 22, telecommunication company Singtel saw an 8 hour long disruption of its 3G and 4G services. Would the Singapore authority take 2 years to issue a fine for Singtel?

43,"The Singapore Government Ministry of Home Affairs published a press release yesterday claiming that the island state is not in a position to take in asylum seekers.
“As a small country with limited land, Singapore is not in a position to accept any persons seeking political asylum or refugee status, regardless of their ethnicity or place of origin”
This press release is based on the backdrop of the influx of asylum seekers from persecuted Muslim minority, the Rohingyas. Both Myanmar and Bangladesh are turning a blind eye on the religion-motivated attacks against the Rohingyas typically by Buddhist extremists from Myanmar. The result of the persecution resulted in tens of thousands of them boarding human smuggler boats sailing along the Straits to seek asylum from other ASEAN countries.
Photo from Asiancorrespondent
However, ASEAN governments like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand displayed their ugly not-in-my-own-backyard mentality taking the lead turning these asylum seekers away using weapon-loaded Navies. In yet another sign proving all talks of ASEAN unity as hypocritical rhetoric, the three best economies of South East Asia claimed they do not have the resources to take care of the asylum seekers.
The Thailand Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said:
“As there are many of them, we cannot look after them properly. Where will we put them? Right now we have to find a place for them to stay. In the future, if many more of them come, it will cause a problem. They will steal the jobs and livelihoods of Thais.”
The Singapore Government, self-proclaim the “first world country” in South East Asia, is also equally hypocritical giving excuses about “a small country with limited land” at asylum seekers, yet at the same time wanting to boost the country population’s to 6.9 million from the current 5.5 million. Earlier on the same week, the Singapore Government introduced up a new visa for China citizens that issues them multiple entries up to 10 years. The Singapore Government clearly put business interests above humanitarian obligations.
It is noted that none of the ASEAN countries is a signatory of the United Nation’s 1951 Refugee Convention.
While many more asylum seekers continue to die at sea, do you think ASEAN should apply more pressure against Myanmar and Bangladesh for their persecutions against the Rohingyas that led to the influx of refugees?

44,"The Singapore Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) has become the first organization in Singapore to be protect from the newly enacted 6-month old Harassment Act. The Harassment Act was popularly known to protect individuals, have today protected the Singapore military stat board MINDEF. The first individual to be protected from the Harassment Act was blogger Xiaxue, who applied for a court application against harassment from vigilante Facebook page SMRT (Feedback).
Yesterday, the Singapore Court ruled that Dr Ting Choon Meng and socio-political website The Online Citizen have made false allegations that the MINDEF stole Dr Ting’s idea for a mobile first-aid vehicle from his company MobileStats Technologies.

MINDEF claimed that such false allegations will undermine their integrity:
“As a Government organisation, MINDEF is held to a high standard of conduct. When false allegations that damage our integrity are made, they can dent public confidence in MINDEF and the Government. MINDEF hopes that all parties involved will respect and abide by the Court’s decision”
The Online Citizen said they will appeal the judgment because “this has serious implications on freedom of expression”.
What do you think if the PAP Government decides to apply for protection under the Harassment Act from socio-political websites? Do you think the Harassment Act can be abused by the Singapore Government to gag free speech?

45,"Dear Amos,
You do not suppose you have sufficient credibility left in you to be taken seriously those who do not belong to the groups of people you have mocked for believing your words, do you?
To be sure, you are entitled to whatever feelings you have of Mr. Vincent Law. You know best what went on between the two of you and no one should have insisted that you should have shown gratitude to him without knowing what had occurred. At the same time, it should be within your right to free speech to voice out your irritation towards him. Nevertheless, what you have essentially admitted to in your latest blog posting is that you had made the allegation of molest with the knowledge that it was going to be construed as sexual molestation, and it is precisely your reference to the other definition of “molest” that shows this. I hope you do see that to use “molest” in the other sense, there has to be sufficient context set up for people to see that you are referring to being annoyed rather than being sexually assaulted. If you did not know of the other definition of “molest” when you made the accusation, it is clear that you had intended to give the impression that you were molested in a sexual way. Even if you did know of the other definition, you had failed to contextualize your claim properly despite knowing the most common use of for the word “molest.”
Screenshot from The Straits Times
It is also clear that you were deliberately sensationalizing the issue when you made the accusation instead of truly being driven to voice out your irritation with Mr. Law. This unfortunately discounts whatever claims of emotional abuse you are now making simply because you are open to exploiting any aspect of your personal experience for sensationalism and media attention. If emotional abuse had been a primary concern from the start, you would not have made a false accusation (or at least one that you knew would be interpreted in ways that did not tally with facts). Ironically, if you had replaced the word “molest” with “emotional abuse,” you would have gotten the attention of the media you simultaneously seem to despise and crave, and your claims to emotional abuse would have gained more credibility.
No matter how much you hated your interactions with Mr. Law, it does not justify the initial accusation of molest and you should apologize because of that accusation alone even if you wish to maintain and pursue your claim of how he had abused you emotionally (though anyone not wishing to be accused of being stupid should really not take your word for it where it comes to this new claim of emotional abuse). It pays to keep separate matters separate.
You do have a healthy dose of suspicion towards those who have been manipulated by media narratives to see Mr. Law as an almost saintly person. You do not, however, give enough credit to those who have remained sufficiently fair-minded from the start despite their objections to certain aspects of your behavior, preferring instead to classify everyone under the umbrella of stupidity you have held over their heads whilst remaining outside its confines yourself. You should have kept your accusations clear and straightforward from the start, and while there may indeed be stupid people urging you to apologize to Mr. Law because they are too easily taken in by media accounts of his character, there are those who have urged you to apologize to him because the accusation should not have been made regardless of his character unless he had indeed molested you in the sense that you clearly wanted people to get at the start. These are the people who will lend you support when you need and deserve it, not those who are egging you on or praising you for the brilliance you have not managed to show.
Face it: you have done something wrong. You are not always right.
Best wishes,
Molly Meek

46,"In an career fair held at the Singapore Expo today, the Senior Minister of State for Manpower and Health Dr Amy Khor has called for elderly Singaporeans to embark on a new career at 50 years old because “it is common to see seniors living past 80 years old”:
“it is common to see seniors living past 80 years old. She said that at 50 years old, it can be the start of a period of “second growth” where seniors learn and experience new things, and pursue new careers.”

The government-controlled mainstream media, Channel News Asia, even featured a senior participant of the “active ageing” career expo today. A certain “Pearl Tang” said she signed up for a Chinese painting class last month and “never looked back”.

Do you think Singaporean elderly working as cleaners and tissue paper peddlers should start their “second growth” as Minister Amy Khor suggested?

47,"According to the latest economic report by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) published on April 28, the proportion of part-time workers in Singapore have grown by 54% from 2008 to 2014.
“First, the steady rise in the share of part-time workers in the resident workforce, from 6.8% in 2008 to 10.5% in 2014, has lowered average wage levels and economy-wide wage growth...”
Photo from atozforex
As foreigners on student pass, Permanent Residents and citizens are allowed to work part-time, it is hard to say more Singaporeans are turning to part-time jobs to supplement their income or who are the particular “resident workforce” the MAS is referring to. The MAS did not explain the actual number of part-time jobs taken up and the breakdown between Singaporeans and Permanent Residents taking up part-time jobs. There is also no explanation on the survey method on how did the MAS arrive to their figures. Even in the Manpower Ministry’s annual income report, there is also no wage growth statistic disclosed to keep track of the income growth of part-time workers.
It is very hard to draw conclusions like saying more Singaporeans are turning to part time jobs because of the increase in cost of living or that their monthly full time wage is insufficient for maintaining their living standards in Singapore, or if a particular group in Singapore has been overlooked by government policies.The Singapore Government disclose incomplete statistics with dubious surveying methods, which needless to say, to skew public perception and put themselves in a better light. Without accurate and comprehensive statistics, how does the PAP Ministers decide which group should they target their policies at?
The very lack of accurate and complete statistics in Singapore could very well be the cause of problems created by out-of-touch government policies.

I asked the bereaved family members if they or the late father was or were affiliated to any pap grassroots or RC. None of them was nor aware of. Further info revealed a guy just pop out of nowhere ask permission to hang up the banner. No flower wreath, no condolences message, nothing about the detail of who send..just that banner.
The wake was at serangoon ave 3 within the pap ward of marine parade grc. The banner itself said nothing of condolences, just pap logo in the middle and the pap braddell heights branch wordings in chinese and english.
Out of respect for the bereaved family, the banner was left where it was but created a minor buzz within the group of visitors who came to pay their last respect. Shame on you pap using the pains of a bereaved family to gain political mileage.
Just to add further the banner look well used old and worn out..so must have repeated the trick over and over again..”

49,"During his speech at a service excellence award ceremony today, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong criticized Singapore for not having good service standards.
“Ask any tourist, or even a Singaporean, which country has good service? I don’t think Singapore will come immediately to mind”
Lee Hsien Loong said Singapore has made “progress” in service standards over the past decade but not quite where it wants to be yet.

He also emphasized the importance of graciousness, courtesy and respect in Singapore society.
“How we treat one another and whether we value and respect one other, says a lot about the kind of society and the kind of people that we are,” he said. “If we aspire to be gracious, courteous, respectful of one another, if we want to live in a place where everyone belongs, doing his part, excelling and serving with pride, then each of us – we have to do our part.”
However, Lee Hsien Loong is also known widely for his defamation suits against his critics and his offending treatment of the Opposition in Parliament. Have a look at the video of his election speech below, what do you think this says about the kind of person that he is?

50,"In her first walkabout since former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s demise, Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Indranee Rajah said that her residents have strong connections with the ruling People’s Action Party. Despite having only winning the GRC through electoral walkovers, the Senior Minister of State also said that there are “strong bonds” in the constituency which will “stand the test of time”:
“...the late founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who was Tanjong Pagar’s longest-serving MP, has left behind a tremendous legacy, and the constituency’s other MPs must work hard to continue this strong connection with residents... There are strong bonds in Tanjong Pagar GRC which will stand the test of time”
Minister Indranee also said that the ground reception from her walkabout is “warm” and that Tanjong Pagar GRC residents are very supportive.
“Our sense on the ground is that people are warm. Many of them have fed back that issues which they have raised have been addressed and dealt with. They have been very encouraging and supportive.”
Ever since the Group Representative Constituency (GRC) system was introduced in 1988, Tanjong Pagar GRC has never gone through any electoral process because Opposition parties were mainly afraid of contesting the constituency against former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who was notorious for “fixing” his political opponents during his reign. During the last election in 2011, Tanjong Pagar GRC was a walkover again due to disqualification of the Opposition team through a late submission of legal documents.

Although former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew died in March this year, the 5-person constituency has been managed by 4 MPs since 2011 due to Lee Kuan Yew’s poor state of health. Lee Kuan Yew’s area, Tanjong Pagar-Tiong Bahru, has been mostly covered by Minister Indranee on top of her Tanglin-Cairnhill area. The next General Election is due by January 2017 but it seems the current Prime Minister, who is also the son of Lee Kuan Yew, will not call for a by-election as a loss of a constituency the size of Tanjong Pagar GRC will destabilize his regime and taint his father’s reputation he painstakingly built.
Many Opposition parties have expressed their interest in contesting for the constituency. Among them are the Singapore Democratic Party, Singaporean First Party, Reform Party and Democratic Progressive Party. Do you think Tanjong Pagar GRC will continue to be a PAP stronghold without Lee Kuan Yew?

51,"Update:
The Foreign Ministry of Thailand has confirmed that they did not sign any agreement with China over the recently much reported construction of the Kra Canal. The Transport Ministry of Thailand has also confirmed that the project is not in their plan.
Although an official admit that China is pushing for the Kra Canal project to go through, the Thai Government raised concerns about national security over the construction of the canal.
However, the Thai officials do not rule out private ventures.

The Thai Security Adviser to the Deputy Prime Minister said that news media has most probably misunderstood from the feasibility studies by the Kra Canal Committee who consisted of businessmen and former government officials from both sides. Officially, both governments did not arrive to a deal.
The China ambassador to Thailand has also denied official involvement with the project.

Thailand: Unlikely of Kra Canal to materialized

China and Thailand were reportedly to have signed an estimated US$20 billion deal to build a man-made canal across Kra Isthmus, South Thailand linking the Andaman Sea and South China Sea. Also known as the Thai Canal, the proposed estimated 26m deep and 102km long sea route has been on the drawing board of Thailand since 1677. In 1897, the British Empire and the Thai Kingdom agreed not to build the canal to protect Singapore’s harbour.
Fast forward 118 years later, the Thai Canal project is finally back and the deal was sealed in Guangzhou last week. The completion of the Thai Canal will bolster several economies like Myanmar’s, Cambodia’s, Vietnam’s and of course Thailand’s. Other beneficiaries of the Thai Canal will be Japan, Taiwan, Korea and India, who would save on shipping costs and avoid the overcrowded Straits at Singapore. The canal might even possibly position Thailand as the world’s busiest sea port. Like a zero sum game, there will be serious implications on Singapore’s maritime industry.

Singapore may have no natural resources, but it’s strategic position is probably one of the best in the world that sits exactly on international sea routes linking the East and West Asia. A trading port since 1819 by its founding father Sir Stamford Raffles, Singapore thrived and prospered with the increase in sea trade over the past 196 years. The Singapore PAP government has also conveniently took advantage of the economic progress brought by the luxurious sea trade, attributing Singapore’s economical success to their politics.
Have a look at the major oil shipping lanes below, do you think Singapore can continue to prosper once the Thai Canal is built?

52,"In a radio interview conducted in Chinese over Singapore Press Holding’s 95.8FM, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong reiterated that it is dangerous of Singaporeans to think which constituency can be given to the Opposition:
“We can’t say at the next election, the next Government is already confirmed and we are now just choosing how many opposition members we want, or which constituencies the opposition should be given more of a chance in. I think this is a dangerous way of thinking”
He also emphasized that every election is serious as it determines the leadership team that will look after citizens and the country’s future.

Looking at a few of Lee Hsien Loong’s policies below, do you think he is capable of looking after citizens and the country’s future as he claimed?
1) 6.9 million population
2) Increase in CPF Minimum Sum and Withdrawal Age
3) Increase in scholarships for foreign students
4) Increase in S pass application approvals
5) Increase of spending in billion dollar projects like Garden By the Bay, Bishan River and the upcoming Project Jewel and Jurong Lake
6) Increase in rich-poor income gap
7) Using of defamation lawsuits and the Media Development Authority to control the media

53,"Through the five polytechnics, the Singapore Government has just introduced a new course called the Enhanced Post-Diploma Certificate, which aims to give refresher course training for polytechnic graduates who wish to re-enter the industry of their diploma taken more than 2 years ago. The course is said to be more intensive and will be as short as one or two months. 10 courses will be offered two times a year, in July and October.
However, it remains to be seen if this 2 month course will be any useful to polytechnic graduates because this certificate is not recognized. Recognized post-diploma advancement certifications are still Advanced Diplomas or bachelor degrees. Having an Enhanced Post-Diploma Certificate effectively render one no advantage over a fresh diploma graduate. Also, it is very likely those who have gone obtained this certification, may still be discounted for the lack of working experience and be offered a fresh diploma graduate’s salary.
According to an exposed diplomatic exchange between Singapore and the United States revealed by WikiLeaks, the Singapore Government does not want more Singaporeans to get their degrees:
“Education System Not Helping
—————————-
¶9. (C) Singapore boasts a highly competitive and
well-regarded primary and secondary education system, but the
number of Singaporeans completing a tertiary education is
relatively low. Only 23 percent of Singaporean students
entering primary school complete a degree at a local
four-year university. In other knowledge-economies such as
Japan’s, around 50 percent of students complete a university
degree. However, according to Cheryl Chan, Assistant 
Director of the Planning Division at the Ministry of 
Education (MOE), the government does not plan to encourage 
more students to get a higher education. The university
enrollment rate will continue to be maintained at 20-25
percent because the Singaporean labor market does not need
everyone to get a four-year degree, she asserted.”
It is hence no surprise why the Singapore Government is today telling Singapore diploma graduates to get an unaccredited post-diploma certificate in the market, and not building more universities or giving subsidies to Singaporeans to upgrade and get their degrees.
In his last National Day Rally speech in 2014, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that there is don’t need to get a degree to live in Singapore:
“They may not have degrees, but they are working hard and trying to improve themselves. So long as you work hard, you can always hope for a brighter future here in Singapore.”
The PAP Minister of National Development who is currently embroiled in the Town Council funding dispute with the Opposition wards, Khaw Boon Wan also said:
“You own a degree, but so what? That you can’t eat it. If that cannot give you a good life, a good job, it is meaningless”
Despite so, the number of foreign degree holders given S and E pass was increased by 77% over the past 5 years.

With the influx of cheap foreign degree holders working at the statutory Minimum of $2200, do you think Singapore diploma graduates can have “a good life and a good job”?

54,"After nearly a year of bad press over its football pitch since its opening in June 2014, the Singapore Sports Hub dodged media scrutiny and secretly engaged a new field contractor, HG Sports Turf, to lay the latest grass pitch. A portion of the new grass pitch was completed and unveiled to the media today (May 19).
According to the Sports Hub, the Australian company HG Sports Turf will supply the FIFA 2 stars graded (professional grade) hybrid grass pitch for 3 years.
Below is the timeline of the fiasco happened to Singapore Sports Hub:
June 2014 – The S$1.3 billion Singapore Sports Hub opened featuring a S$833,000 Desso Grassmaster system hybrid of natural and synthetic grass.
18 Aug 2014 – Juventus coach chose not to field Carlos Tevez because he find the grass pitch unsafe:
“Tevez was rested as a precaution we wanted to avoid injuries on this sandy pitch.”
24 Aug 2014 – Minister Lawrence Wong responded to criticisms saying the grass need time to grow.
13 Oct 2014 – Brazil coach said “while the pitch was playable, it was also far short of international playing standards”. Japan coach and goalkeeper relayed the same message saying they will not be able to perform their best with the state of the pitch.
Sep 2014 – Australian Director Gregory Gillin tendered his resignation.
Oct 2014 – S$1.5 million worth of special lighting installed to help the grass “grow”
Photo by The Straits Times
Mar 2015 – Singapore National head coach Bernd Stange ran out of patience and criticized the pitch:
“All my promises I gave to bring teams over with my personal contacts to speak with (Iran coach Carlos) Queiroz, with (Russia coach) Fabio Capello and others depend on a ready Sports Hub. Unfortunately, a lot of teams refuse to play Singapore on the artificial pitch. Even Japan refused to make training sessions here (at the Jalan Besar Stadium) before they played Brazil (at the National Stadium last year) ... As long as the (National Stadium’s pitch at the) Sports Hub is not ready, we cannot attract big teams. I did everything, but it’s difficult to convince teams to play there.”
The next upcoming mega event will be the 2015 SEA Games in June, do you think the grass will be ready by then?

55,"City Harvest Church’s founder and singer Reverend Sun Ho Yeow Sun was in court today for a hearing and said she has never asked how well her music albums were selling and simply thought her albums were selling so well she was about to get a Platinum award.
The 42 year old gave her testimonial for the first time where 6 of her church leaders, including her husband Pastor Kong Hee, were facing charges of misappropriating church funds to fund Sun Ho’s album sales.
She also said that the US producers were confident of her singing abilities and her US album was working towards “multi-millions of sales”.

The 6 City Harvest Church leaders are facing trial for misusing $24 million of church building funds to buy sham bonds in two companies, Xtron Productions and Firna, which were set up by close friends of the 6 leaders, in a finances circulation technique called round tripping in an attempt to hide the loss of funds from auditors.
Sun Ho’s husband, Kong Hee, is represented by PAP Moulmein-Kallang MP Edwin Tong. Kong Hee was also co-own a penthouse at Ocean Drive, Sentosa Cove paying about S$17,000 a month. The City Harvest Church he founded boast a $48 million “titanium” building, and is one of the richest churches in the world.

56,"Filipino actors of the $2 million musical about Singapore’s turbulent times during the 1950s are trying to be as Singaporean as possible. Aside from learning how to speak Singlish, the Filipino actors said they can relate the present state of the Philippines with Singapore during the 1950-1960 period.
Photo from Capitol Theatre and musical Singapura
Actor Joel Trinidad said:
“That’s what really struck me – that there were riots, hunger, and poverty, and corruption; all this stuff that my own country has been going through for many, many, many years,” he said. “But what is significant to me about this musical, having done all the research, is that if you guys could do it, why can’t we do it? So on a personal level it’s an inspiration to me – your story is an inspiration to me and my country.”
Ironically, the $2 million production, Singapura, is anything but Singaporean. The composer is a Filipino, the director is Filipino and the lead actors are all Filipinos. Out of the 48 casts in the musical, only 11 are Singaporeans.
However actor David Bianco believe the musical would still be a success:
“You look at Miss Saigon. I mean that particular play you had Filipinos playing Vietnamese. It played and was a rousing success internationally.”
The Filipino musical, Singapura, will run in Capitol Theatre until June 7, but unfortunately the very nature of this musical is untimely and too sensitive for Singaporeans today especially when the Singapore Government has openly expressed preferential treatment to foreigners in national policies. Many foreigners have used Singapore as a stepping stone and took full advantage of its permanent residency and generous scholarships, up to $200 million a year, the Singapore Government showered them with.
New citizens do not have to serve National Service, and S and E pass holder foreigners have a minimum wage of $2,200 and $3,300 respectively. Foreigners are also exempted from CPF, enjoy low income taxes and equal rights in the queue for car ownership COE certificates and employment opportunities.
The influx of foreigners in Singapore have evidently created an upward pressure in cost of living, a depression of local salaries, drop in overall standard of living and severe social conflicts which saw the result of an “illegal” strike and riot in Singapore for the first time in 50 years. When the Singapore Government announced their plan for a 6.9 million population, a record turnout of 5,000 Singaporeans took to Honglim Park to protest against the immigration policy.

Despite so, the Singapore Government remains undaunted by the opposition from its voters, and dismissing them as a “vocal minority”. Just recently, the PAP team of Tanjong Pagar GRC said that the residents have strong connections for the ruling PAP. The Media Development Authority has also clamped down on alternate news sites by forcing them to be gazetted, registered or even forcibly shut down. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has also stepped up his election effort by suing an internet blogger for defamation and the government-controlled media Singapore Press Holdings has also taken the opportunity to issue copyrights infringement lawsuits against internet bloggers.
The Singapore Government may be unpopular, but as they believe they can continue to be in power, they see fit to continue policies without consultation from the people.

57,"The Social Progress Index (SPI) is a measurement of social progress published by a team led by Harvard Business School Professor Michael Green. The professor said that a nation’s progress is not simply measured by only its GDP and that countries with the same GDP may have very different national progres. The latest report is out today and here is a summary of how Singapore actually fare as compared to other first world countries namely, Japan, United States, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and South Korea:
1) Singapore is the most ill-informed society
With the lowest score among first world countries of 75.32 in Access to Information and Communications, and a 44.29 in Press Freedom Index, Singaporeans is statistically the most ill-informed people. Also at an alarming score of 56.74, Singaporeans has the least access to Advanced Education compared to citizens of other first world countries.
Screenshot from Social Progress Imperative
2) Singapore is the worst in political rights
No other first world countries have a raw score of 3 in political rights, but Singapore have a 4. Freedom of speech is a 0 and freedom of assembly is only a 1.
3) Singapore is the most discriminatory country against minorities
Race and religion minorities are the most discriminated in Singapore than in any other first world country. Although Singapore rank high in religious tolerance, the raw score for discrimination is at its lowest at 2.8.
4) Other findings that break typical Singaporean beliefs
Singapore is no longer the least corrupted country, the first is New Zealand. Singapore is also not xenophobic at all, it ranks better than Japan and Korea in the tolerance for immigrants section. Singapore has also the lowest internet users even though it has the highest mobile subscriptions. Adult literacy rate is actually the lowest in Singapore than other first world countries. Singapore also rank better than United States, Japan and Korea in terms of housing affordability. Singaporeans are the most likely to die from infectious diseases too.

58,"The Singapore Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) found that at least 38% of the pet shops and 83% of the pet farms in Singapore have no basic welfare for their animals. Basic welfare include having a cage of a comfortable size for the animal and access to clean drinking water at all times.
Photo from Happypaws
A two-month plainclothes operation was conducted by ACRES staff and volunteers between March and May, which sampled 41 pet shops and 12 farms. An astounding finding revealed that 7 out of 11 pet shops which was awarded Grade A under the Singapore’s animal regulatory board AVA’s Pet Shop Grading Scheme breached the basic welfare requirements. The report of the grading scheme breaches has been submitted to AVA but the government regulatory body did not say if there is any punishment for the offenders.
The head of campaigns for ACRES, Ms Noelle Seet, said:
“We encourage the public to be the check and balance of the pet industry as consumer demand wields much influence over industry practices”
However, if the AVA is not going to introduce any punishment for shops that breaches the licensing rules, do you think it is a waste of time whistle blowing to the government regulatory body?

59,"New residents who have received their keys for Senja Gateway Built-to-Order (BTO) flats in Bukit Panjang are complaining about the quality of their floor tiles. Apparently the most typical complain is that the tiles are too rough, not easy to clean, different colour arrangement and a range of other issues associated with the quality of the floor tiles provided by the BTO contractor.
Here are a few photos taken from the closed group “Senja Gateway Building Issues”:
   
Residents of Senja Gateway BTO have taken their complains to the resident MP Liang Eng Hwa and had two meetings with the MP and Resident Committee (RC) of the area. However nothing have been done.
Although the Singapore government-controlled mainstream media The Straits Times also carried their complain, the 154th ranking newspaper said that HDB workers managed to clean off the stain within 3 minutes for a case where a flooring stain could not be removed.
A resident posted on the secret Facebook group that the recent Trivelis DBSS project managed to get compensations offered from their developer because their residents have made it a national news.
Do you think the HDB should be responsible like the private developers to the Trivelis DBSS residents and compensate Senja Gateway BTO owners too?

Although an official admit that China is pushing for the Kra Canal project to go through, the Thai Government raised concerns about national security over the construction of the canal.
However, the Thai officials do not rule out private ventures.

The Thai Security Adviser to the Deputy Prime Minister said that news media has most probably misunderstood from the feasibility studies by the Kra Canal Committee who consisted of businessmen and former government officials from both sides. Officially, both governments did not arrive to a deal.

The Kra Canal news stemmed from media reports in China, which later went international with news media like the Daily Telegraph and maritime industry watchers like the International Institute of Marine Surveying.

61,"The top student of Nanyang Polytechnic’s School of Interactive and Digital Media became the first recipient of the Lee Hsien loong Award. Jerome Yap is a late bloomer who used to have only a PSLE score of 98 studied hard and excelled to graduate from the top of his cohort in NYP with a GPA of 3.9 out of a possible 4.0.
However, it was not reported if Jerome Yap or any other top graduates of NYP received any offers of scholarships like the ASEAN scholarship which is typically given to top foreign students from foreign institutions.
Another odd part about the academic award created in 2009 is the using of the name Lee Hsien Loong, who is the current Prime Minister of Singapore. Lee Hsien Loong is by far the most unpopular Prime Minister in Singapore history and his policies especially in immigration, housing, transport, media censorship and healthcare are not only controversial and fiercely debated on, they are also inefficient and created very drastic social barometers like high income gap and low purchasing power.

The Lee Hsien Loong award comes from the Ministry of Education and the award funding is from public taxes and not from a single cent of the most well paid politician in the world.
Do you think MOE is used as a political tool for Lee Hsien Loong’s coming election?

63,"If you are a keen reader and active commentator of popular socio-political websites like The Online Citizen, States Times Review or the now-defunct The Real Singapore, you can set up one yourself for less than $50 a year.

The purpose of this post is to encourage STR readers to take an active interest in writing Singapore news and commentaries.
1) Think of a good name
Oh remove “The” e.g. The Straits Times. Don’t ask me why but it is just bad marketing.
2) Create your domain address
You can choose from a buffet of web hosts but I recommend BlueHost.com. Simply pick a domain name e.g. statestimesreview.com and for beginners, use WordPress structure as they are filled with free templates. Those who have got free time can customize and experiment their site on their own, otherwise the entire process to getting an established site should take you less than 15 minutes.
3) Content creating
This is where your creativity and inspiration take form with content creation. Personally, some of my content creation techniques are:
-News Reproduction, where I recycle news information from various news sites of the same report to combine them into one report. This is especially useful for those who are good at interpreting an article from different angles.
-Comments Featuring. Just go to Facebook or forums and take a screengrab and build on the comments.
-Opinions and Commentaries. Write down your prejudices and analysis of a certain topic, its pretty tiring to do it yourself though, if you are looking at quantity, you would need a steady stream of contributors or blogs to follow.
-Exposes. You will have to be actively online to cover these news within half an hour. However, beware of inaccuracies as news of an ongoing are constantly updated and sources may be incorrect.
-Statistics. Draw your own conclusions from the numbers and figures.
4) Share your content everywhere
Video. Comics. Articles. Whatever. Share them on forums and interact with your commentators. Your commentators help make you a better content creator.
5) Get Google Adsense
Monetize your site to be a little bit more motivated each time your write, but remember it is your content that what makes people click on your site.
Remember: Quality over Quantity. Patience pays, take your time and produce quality work. Churning out articles without making an effort will turn readers away. Emphasize on originality and content creation. Singapore is still short of writers, we need more writers to raise awareness for Singaporeans.
The Singapore Press Holdings has a wide range of mainstream media news makers, yet the number of online alternative news sites is only a handful. It is time to increase the number of socio-political news sites to provide a true alternative to the mainstream media.

64,"Singapore’s privatized public transport operator SMRT announced in their biennial company dinner yesterday (May 21) that they will be donating $100,000 to “help the poor and needy” after booking a $91 million for Financial Year 2015.
Photo from The Straits Times
The news was carried by Singapore government-controlled mainstream media Channel News Asia in what seems to be another public relations attempt to whitewash SMRT’s strew of unpopular train breakdowns and fare hike for profit.
In the May of 2014, the Singapore government through the Public Transport Council raised public train and bus fares which led to the roaring profits of the two Temasek Holdings-owned transport conglomerates: SMRT and ComfortDelgro (SBS).
Despite the fare hike, service standards worsen and the issues of overcrowding in train stations remained unaddressed. According to the Land Transport Authority, between January and September of 2014, there were 36 SMRT train delays lasting more than 10 minutes and 266 SMRT train delays lasting more than 5 minutes. The statistic has not yet accounted for SBS trains.
In the past, public trains and buses were nationalized and train break downs were unheard of. Today, the public transport is privatized and commercialized to maximize profits from commuters. The 2 corporations are irresponsible and unapologetic for their actions because there is no market competition in Singapore.
Along with the Singapore Government, SMRT and SBS have received criticisms for the soaring profits that correlates with the increasing fare hikes every year. Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew has largely been on the receiving end of these criticisms due to his incapability to solve the woes of overcrowding and fare hikes.

65,"During a Social Service Partners Conference held today (May 22), the new Minister for Social and Family Developments Tan Chuan Jin made a controversial remark that single parent and cross-cultural families are complex issues:
“A small but increasing number of families are facing complex issues, such as divorce and cross-cultural families... such trends will impact how the Government shapes its policies moving forward.”
The term “cross-cultural families” can be defined as inter-racial or international marriages, while “divorced families” clearly means single-parent families. The Minister did not further explain why are these families “complex issues” and how he define “straight-forward” families.

Tan Chuan Jin however did reiterate the Singapore Government’s stance on a nuclear family:
“Families form the foundation of a strong nation. Having a better understanding of emerging trends affecting families ... will help us as a Government and community to better support families”
Despite having paying the same taxes and serving the same 2 year National Service stint, single parent families are not recognized by the Singapore Government and hence are denied housing subsidies and maternal benefits enjoyed by nuclear families.
International marriages between a Singaporean and a foreigner also face many obstacles like when the foreign spouse face visa and employment obstacles.
Given Singapore’s rapidly falling birth rate, do you think it is time the Singapore Government end their discrimination against single-parent and “cross-cultural” families?

67,"The Singapore Elections Department under Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will be spending up to S$30 million on logistic alone. The lucrative logistic tender was issued on the 6th of May and will be closed for submission on the 9th of June.
From 9th of June onward, the submissions for the tender will be valid for only 6 months. This has since fueled speculations in the mainstream media that the next General Elections will be happening this year in 2015.
However, based on official figures, the latest the next GE could be called for is in January 2017. The Elections Department has also clarified that the tender call up is only a “routine work” and dismisses speculations when will the elections happen.
There will most likely be an increase in the number of polling stations from 732 in 2011, to 850 this election. This is most probably attributed to the ruling party PAP’s electoral strategy to cut its losses by increasing the number of Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) to cushion potential defeats from Group Representative Constituencies (GRCs). In the last general election, the PAP lost Aljunied GRC, and subsequently lost 2 by-elections to the Workers’ Party by a substantial margin. The PAP Government, through the Ministry of National Development, has since began withholding town council funding to the Workers’ Party Town Council citing “worries over finances” even when the Attorney General Officer found no fault in an independent audit.

“There are already existing laws to regulate the use and display of national symbols, such as the Singapore flag and anthem. This comes under the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act, which states how Singaporeans can use the symbols to identify with the nation.
The Act also seeks to ensure that national symbols are treated with dignity and respect. The Government is studying laws that can be put in place particularly to prevent misleading use and commercial exploitation of Mr Lee’s name and image.”

Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia has since come to a deal in a meeting to help the asylum seekers with the sole absence of Singapore. The three governments agreed to take in 7,000 more asylum seekers and are also currently scouring for more boats in the sea, again with the exception of Singapore.
More than 3,600 Rohingya asylum seekers have arrived in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, with thousands more still stranded at seas.

“SkillsFuture is really there to enable you to decide and to spend that money on your own upgrading to get you job-ready. So it’s going to totally change how we view training and development. Companies will have to catch up, because if companies don’t provide training to their staff, their staff don’t need them to sponsor their (training). They can actually use the SkillsFuture training money to decide.”
In 2015’s Budget, Singaporeans are given $500 free credit in their SkillsFuture account which basically gives them a $500 discount to certificate, diploma and degree courses which naturally could cost as much as tens of thousands.
However, as the role of a government, shouldn’t Minister Grace Fu work on getting companies to sponsor relevant training instead of telling Singaporeans to pay more money out of their own pockets for training?

73,"There are two classes of Singaporeans today.
One grew up in a good school and spend their time attending tuition and attending private training in music or sports. Their cohort are of similar backgrounds and they always compare their grades and ranking in class. With all the time and resources spent on education, this group attend good schools and eventually get into JCs then into established universities without having to take up a loan. Those who attend local universities even get subsidies from the government. They study full time without worries about living allowance and school fees, and get good grades, and some fortunate ones get scholarships. After graduation they get internships or land themselves a graduate post in the civil service or multi-national companies (MNCs) through family referrals without a need for working experience.
The other class of Singaporeans grew up in neighbourhood schools and their only supplementary are only remedial lessons offered by schools. Their family cannot afford tuition and their parents work from morning to night. They spend their free time hanging around in malls and the neighbourhood, and the typical expectations from their grades is a pass from their parents and school teachers. After all, nobody expect them to score A. Many got into polytechnics or ITEs and work part time to alleviate the financial stress off their parents. Some who are better get into universities, but unfortunately, many could not afford their university schools fees and have to work part time. Some chose to work full time for a few years and study their degrees part time. Most who took the degree route working part time ended up with grades not so outstanding because they have to juggle with work commitments. They took up education debt as much as $24,000 with no subsidies from the government. After graduation, they are unable to find a job because they have no referrals and relevant working experience. They ended up in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with bosses telling them their degrees are irrelevant to their work scope.
The cycle for this 2 classes of Singaporeans repeats.
In Singapore, Meritocracy is used as an excuse to justify the support rich people enjoyed in their formative years, and conveniently, an attack on the poor for not “working hard”. Nobody is ever on a level playing field even in Singapore which boast of “world class” ITEs and Polytechnics. Your certificate and diploma will never be as exclusive as a NUS degree.
The Singapore Government has also instituted social barriers to ensure there is no social mobility, like not having a Minimum Wage, providing free education up to tertiary level and providing a state-funded allowance to all students. Again of course, in the name of “Meritocracy” why poor people should not be helped.
These are government policies and hence the essential solution is a political one. A change in necessary government policies warrant a necessary political change. Please remove the PAP out of power regardless of the constituency you are in because election decisions is always national.

74,"A 22 year old Vietnamese student from the National University of Singapore (NUS) was jailed for 3 weeks for taking upskirt videos of women. On the September of 2014, Dung Tri Nguyen caught by his 27 year old victim for using his Samsung Galaxy mobile phone to take a video recording between her legs. His phone was confiscated and recordings of upskirt videos taken in MRT stations were also found from his phone.

Dung Tri Nguyen is a second year student with NUS and will be starting his student exchange with a reputable company as his lawyer said. According to his Linkedin profile, Dung Tri Nguyen was also an elderly care volunteer at Ang Mo Kio’s Thye Hua Kwan Hospital.
There is a high chance Dung Tri Nguyen is a Singapore-sponsored ASEAN scholarship holder because typical high school diplomas from Vietnam is not eligible for direct enrollment into NUS.

The established travel agency put up a post on its Facebook page (May 23) saying that the company has closed for business and advised existing customers with unfulfilled trips to seek claims from the Small Claims Tribunal or CASE. Its staffs and customers at its Chinatown Point’s shop were all not notified before the closure, and it appears they will have issues getting their salaries from the bankrupted company too.
Asia-Euro Holidays Facebook Page
Lian He Wan Bao reported that up to 500 customers are affected and a spokesperson was initially reported saying that the company went into financial difficulties because of property investments and the Singapore Government’s property cooling measures introduced in 2012. However, it seems that the company has collapsed because of the gambling addiction of their director, and not because of the property cooling measures as mentioned.
Just last year February, a CPIB assistant director was charged for corruption after he lost S$478,583 at the Singapore casinos. Also in 2014, the number of bankruptcy hit a 4 year high ever since the Singapore casinos were built.

76,"The HDB is launching one of its most affordable BTO prices ever in recent years, with 2-room flats going as low as S$28,000 and 3-room flats from S$132,000 after Additional CPF Housing Grant (up to S$40,000) and Special CPF Housing Grant (up to S$20,000).
These BTO flats are at a housing district called Punggol Northshore, with two projects namely Northshore Residences I and II. Located along Punggol Way, next to a Samudera LRT station which is still closed due to lack of demand. The 4,040 BTO units are expected to be completed in 5 years times on Q2 2020, along with other new launches in Tampines, Sembawang and Clementi.
Punggol Northshore flats will also boast of an energy monitoring system and sensor-detection carpark system similar that of condominiums.

The announcement come timely in an election period which might take place in less than 18 months. Incidentally, the Punggol Northshore is launched right next to the Opposition Workers’ Party-held Punggol-East ward, who won the constituency from a former PAP MP Michael Palmer after he resigned for having an affair with his grassroots leader.

77,"According to the latest official inflation report today, the prices of Education and Food have risen 3.2% and 2.1% respectively year on year from 2014 April. The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) has fallen by 0.5% as a result of falling oil prices, transport and properties.
The category which registers the most significant fall is Housing and Utilities at -3.7%. Singapore’s property prices have been on a free fall for over a year since its prices peaked in 2014. Clothing and Footwear has always taken the plunge due to the weak retail resulting from high rentals in commercial shopping areas.

78,"An Indonesian maid has been sentenced to be jailed for 12 years for culpable homicide not amounting to murder of her employer’s 16 year old daughter. Tuti Aeliyah, 30, was verified by medical professionals to be severely depressed with psychotic symptons at the time of the act. The High Court judge Woo Bih Li accepted the explanation that her mental conditions were behind the killing and said he sympathized with her mental conditions.

The incident happened in November 2013 where in a HDB flat Block 856B at Tampines Street 82. The Indonesian maid first stabbed her employer’s daughter, Shameera Basha Noor Basha, in her sleep then strangled her to death with her school pinafore between 7am and 1pm on that fateful Thursday.
Tuti has been with the family for over a year but according to the neighbours, she always looked stressed out and skinnier than when she first joined the family. A resident who lived next block then found Tuti pacing back and forth along the common corridor a week before the killing happened.
However there were no findings of maid abuse after she was arrested.

79,"An Indonesian PhD student from National University of Singapore (NUS) has been jailed 6 weeks for molesting a 20 year old student on the MRT from Buona Vista to Jurong East. He was arrested by security officers after the lady confronted him for rubbing his groin against her.
Irfan Syanjaya, 26, said in court:
“She seemed to have no negative thoughts about me so I did not move away. I assumed she had no problem about me standing where I was.”

Although Irfan is a NUS PhD student, he required a translator in court.
This is the second NUS student convicted of molest. Just yesterday (May 25), a Vietnamese NUS student was jailed 3 weeks for taking upskirt videos of women.
The two foreign students are most likely on Singapore Government-sponsored scholarships because both Indonesian and Vietnamese schools are not recognized for direct enrollment into NUS.

80,"Singapore’s top accounting firm KPMG released a survey report on 8th of May this month revealing that there have been more construction project failures in the past 3 years than before. Below is a summary of the findings:
1) 69% of the projects are over-budget by more than 10%
2) 75% are behind project deadlines by more than 10% from the original deadline
3) 68% of the project owners have no high level of trust with their contractors
4) 69% of the project owners see poor contractor performance as the main reason for project under-performance
In the recent months, there have been many reports about poor workmanship surfacing about HDB Built-to-Order (BTO) flats. Construction tenders are often offered to the lowest bidders which result in having contractors undercutting each other by providing the bare minimum standards to their clients. The contractors also took advantage of Manpower Ministry’s loose labour laws by depressing salaries of the construction workers who usually come from third world countries and are often uneducated.
Photo from Linkedin
Just in December 2014, the number of work permit holders approved reached a historical high of 991,300, closing on the 1 million work permit holder mark. Although correlation may not be causation, it is hard to divorce from the fact that the increase in foreign workers have resulted in lower quality not only in the construction sector but also the service sector.
Do you think it is time to implement a high unionized Minimum Wage for construction workers to incentivize them to be more productive, achieve higher quality and also at the same time attract locals to work like as in first world countries?

In 2014, there was a hospital bed crunch and patients had to be hospitalized in make-shift tents. The hospital bed crunch is a result of the disparity between the increasing Singapore population and the number of public healthcare facilities.

Since 2006, the Singapore Government imported an influx of foreign construction workers from China, India and Bangladesh. The current number of Work Permit Holders for the Construction Sector alone is estimated to be at least 200,000. There have been speculations believing that the low quality workmanship is a result of using cheap and untrained foreign labour.
Housing prices for BTO 4-room flats range around S$260,000 in far flung areas to S$450,000 in mature estates without subsidies. Singapore homeowners would normally borrow 25 years of loan to finance their mortgage. Despite such high costs, the HDB refuse to declare the construction costs of each flat, except to lament about losing hundreds of millions each year (see video below):

“The biomedical manufacturing cluster’s output declined 28.6% in April 2015 compared to a year ago.  The medical technology segment expanded 28.1%, on account of robust demand for medical devices and supplies.  On the contrary, the pharmaceuticals output fell 38.0% with lower production of active pharmaceutical ingredients and biological products. On a year-to-date basis, the biomedical manufacturing cluster decreased 10.0% compared to the same period a year ago.”

The crash led to an overall manufacturing decline of 8.7%. However, even when the biomedical sector is excluded, the overall output still declined by 1.9%. Other sectors that performed poorly based on year-on-year basis are as follow:
Transport Engineering -8.7%
Aerospace Engineering -9.1%
General Manufacturing -5.1%
Precision Engineering -2.1%

In a press release announced today that the Arifil has been detained since April 2015 pending an investigation outcome on the extent of his extremism.

Arifil had only secondary school education and his radicalisation began around 2013 which he eventually made plans to join the global terror group ISIS in Syria. He was supportive of the violent acts like publicised beheading and started approaching individuals online whom he believed could help him join the ISIS. He actively did his research on the travel routes to Syria and the making of home-made explosive devices.
In the investigation, Arifil confessed that if he was unable to join ISIS, he intended to carry out terrorist attacks in Singapore like attacking key facilities and assassinating the PAP government leaders. Arifil had also attempted to recruit more people to conduct his terrorist plot but to no avail. Those people whom he approached however did not inform the police of Arifil’s terror tendency.
In another case also involving a Singaporean youth, a 17 year old has been detained this month (May 2015) for investigations on the extent of his radicalisation.

Terence Ng Kean Meng owns a cobbler stall near Commonwealth MRT station, which is also where he first approached the school girl who had then ran away from home. He then offered to be her “godfather”, and even went to see her then-seriously sick mother to seek her consent for taking care of the girl.

However, within the first five weeks after they first met, Terence Ng started having consensual sex and masturbation with the minor in three occasions. He was caught only after the 13 year old filed a police report on the advice of a friend she confided into.
Terence Ng’s defence lawyer Subir Singh Grewal said in court today that the relationship between the two started out as platonic, but this is objected by the prosecution who claimed that Terence Ng started off the relationship with sexual intent.
The defence lawyer later presented Terence Ng’s mother in court who filed a statement, saying that her son has always been filial, and that there was a psychiatric report 36 years ago saying Terence Ng was lagging behind in physical and mental development.
The judge eventually ruled Terence Ng guilty on two counts of statutory rape under Section 375 of the Penal Code. He will serve his sentence start today.

The judge took into consideration that Sahari is a repeat sex offender and sentenced him to 11 months of jail with corrective training – a reinforced corrective action facility for repeat offenders with no remission for good behaviour. In his last sex offense in 2009, he was jailed with corrective training for 5 years and six strokes of the cane.

Minister K Shanmugam also declared that he stood by his previous comment and insisted that the AHPETC’s conduct was “unlawful”, despite having the MND losing the court’s case to AHPETC.
His comment could be in contempt of Judge Quentin Loh’s judgment. The role of the Law Minister is Legislative, and even though he is in power to write new laws, the Law Minister has no jurisdiction over the Executive, which in this case is the due process and the final judgment delivered.

93,"In what seems like a subtle jibe at the present Lee Hsien Loong’s administration, Emeritus Senior Minister commented is a media interview yesterday (May 29) that he doesn’t want to live in an ungracious society even when it is the richest in the world:
“...while Singapore’s rapid economic development had driven wages up, the opportunity cost of time had increased too, leaving people feeling more hurried and overlooking the need to be gracious in everyday life. If competition drives people to look out only for themselves and their own families, it would be tragic. I do not want to live in such a society even if it is the richest country in the world”
Ever since his handover of premiership to Lee Kuan Yew’s son, Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore has been on an overdrive for GDP and economic growth. GST has been nearly doubled from 4% to 7% and a housing bubble formed leaving many Singaporeans in a lower standard of living under Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong than the time under Goh Chok Tong.

Unlike his predecessors, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong believe only economic growth and intense competition will uplift the whole of Singapore society. Singaporeans today now work the longest hours in the world, at 2,402.4 hours in a year, way higher than its nearest “competitor” Taiwan at 2,140.8 hours in 2013. Lee Hsien Loong has also this to said about the lack of work life balance in Singapore:
“If you look at other countries: Vietnam, China, even in India, they’re not talking about work-life balance; they are hungry, anxious, about to steal your lunch. So I think I’d better guard my lunch.”
Will you prefer Goh Chok Tong’s preference of graciousness over competition instead?

Calvin Cheng’s warning however has been rebuked by Alfian Sa’at whose response has been well received with 2,079 likes and 232 shares. You may read them in full here:
“Last one before I wash my hand of this tawdry ex-NMP, ex-price-fixer, ex-young-PAP and current has-been-yet-wannabe affair. Uh, yucks:
I have been off Facebook for almost two weeks, trying to find some quiet time. The grief comes in waves and the feelings are still raw.
Imagine then my shock at reading Calvin Cheng’s post, trying to link me and my writings with radicalised youths, calling me a ‘domestic agitator’ who deserves to be detained without trial once ‘red lines are crossed’ (of course with draconian instruments like the ISA the definition of this ‘red line’ is meant to be conveniently arbitrary).
Was this a response to something recent that I posted? No. It was a response to the recent ISA arrests of some Muslim youths. And somehow Calvin Cheng found it necessary to tar me with the same brush, perhaps in the hope of threatening me to keep silent, or not raise questions about certain issues that make him uncomfortable—or that he doesn’t have the capacity to rebut robustly and convincingly.
The suggestion that I might be linked to Muslim extremism would be hilarious if not for the fact that Calvin Cheng thinks that it is a valid charge. He probably has no idea about how I’ve been attacked by those from the Wear White campaign and accused of being a ‘secular fundamentalist’. He doesn’t know that my play, ‘Nadirah’, was about interfaith understanding, and that my play ‘Parah’ critiqued Malay-Muslim ethnocentricism in Malaysia. These details don’t bother him, because he probably thinks that when you want to get a Muslim person to shut up, then you go full on McCarthy and try to associate him with terrorism. Which is its own kind of racism.
I have at various times tried to record the experiences of being a Malay minority in Singapore. And they have all been above board–it’s there in my plays, my books. These works have been funded by government bodies, which have very strict guidelines on anything that might cause racial and religious discord. Online, I don’t join clandestine closed groups and polemicise in echo chambers. The very fact that my posts are set to public means that just about anyone is free to tell me whether I have indeed crossed a line, like for example if any of my points about Singapore not honouring the ideals of multiculturalism is seen as vile hate speech against the Chinese. Calvin Cheng would have ample opportunity to engage me on these matters. And if indeed he had reasonable arguments to offer, then I would most certainly temper my posts. But he has chosen not to, and instead snipes at me without specifying which of my writings fall into the category of ‘terrorist propaganda’—which is what those youths (in MHA’s account) had been exposed to.
I actually think that this Calvin Cheng has had me in his gunsights for a while now. I don’t write exclusively about race, and I’m sure my writings about Amos Yee or Lee Kuan Yew must have pissed him off in some way. So he seizes the opportunity to lambast me based on some current event and spectacularly misfires.
The online world is a strange one. For some reason some of the most articulate social commentators—Alex Au, Andrew Loh, Carlton Tan, Howard Lee, Vincent Wijeysingha, Kirsten Han, Lynn Lee, Joshua Chiang, Gwee Li Sui, Imran Mohd Taib, Sudhir Thomas, Loh Kah Seng, Thum Ping Tjin, Isrizal, Martyn See, Chris Ho, Donald Low (whose smackdown of Calvin Cheng really revealed what an intellectual pygmy the latter was) etc—tend to be critical of aspects of the establishment. And in the other corner, we have Jason Chua and Calvin Cheng. It must be terribly frustrating and lonely. Once I get past my annoyance, I realise that what I really feel for Calvin Cheng is pity. Pity that the sheer paucity of people in his corner has led him to think that he is bigger than he really is. Pity that his responses in the wake of his slander has run along the lines of yapping taunts like ‘come sue me’, ‘come slap me now...you don’t have the balls’, ‘take a queue number’, ‘make me take down the flag from my profile (if you think I dishonour it)’. Pity that in shooting his mouth off, he’s succeeded in shooting the messenger–oh, and his own foot.
So, no need to sue him lah. I think I’m already doing him a favour by even mentioning him here. Let him slip back into oblivion after this cynical shot at self-publicity.”
Other commentators have also expressed their disapproval of Calvin Cheng’s deliberate singling out of Alfian Sa’at, deeming it unnecessary and mischievous. Some have encouraged Alfian Sa’at to sue the former NMP while others advised to leave the NMP alone in his senseless rant.

96,"Assistant law professor, Sundram Peter Soosay, 43, from the National University of Singapore (NUS) was convicted yesterday (May 29) for assaulting a 70 year old cab driver while intoxicated over a S$20 cab fare. The Singapore Permanent Resident foreign talent had bashed the cabby savagely, leaving his victim bloodied and needing multiple stitches.
Photo from NUS Law School
Asst Prof Soosay had boarded Mr Sun Chun Hua’s taxi in the wee hours on Christmas Day. Heavily intoxicated after drinking too much at a Christmas Eve gathering, the professor soon vomited in the taxi after getting in. He alighted near King Albert Park and staggered away without paying his taxi fare. The 70 year old taxi driver then chased him for the cab fare, which Asst Prof Soosay then handed him a $50 note and, in his drunken state, threatened to call the police. As the taxi driver went to retrieve the change from his taxi, the drunk professor then struck him from behind. According to an eye-witness, the professor then sat on the 70 year old and punched his face repeatedly.
District Judge Victor Yeo who found Asst Prof Soosay guilty, said that his testimony was “riddled with hindsight reasoning, convenient conjecture and hypothesis” and inconsistent with the statement he made with the police:
“Despite the accused’s intoxicated state, he seemed able to recall with great clarity how Mr Sun had behaved aggressively towards him”
Asst Prof Soosay will be sentenced on June 26. He faces a maximum jail term of two years and a S$5000 fine.
The Asst Prof who has lived in Scotland for 20 years, has been suspended without pay following his conviction, and NUS “will now determine what further disciplinary action should be taken”.
It remains to be seen if NUS will sack the Malaysia-born professor who has tarred the university’s name with his drunk antics.

97,"The Singapore National Wages Council (NWC) has issued a proposal to employers in Singapore to give a pay raise of S$60 for all low wage workers. In their proposal, they have also re-defined “low-wage workers” covering anyone who earn S$1,100 a month on a full time basis. Previously, only those who earned S$1,000 and below are considered as “low-wage”.
It is unknown how the NWC arrive to the definition of “low-wage”. In 2013, a survey on poverty by the National University of Singapore (NUS) revealed that a “working poor” is someone who earns less than S$1,920. You may read more findings of the NUS report here.
A typical low-wage worker on S$1,100 a month will take home only S$880 after CPF deductions, well below the “working poor” wage of S$1,920 as defined by NUS.
The Singapore Business Federation (SBF) however voiced their opposition against the S$60 wage growth saying that wage increment is already ahead of productivity growth because productivity growth declined by 0.8% while wages grew 4.9% in 2014.

The Chief Operating Officer of SBD, Victor Tay said:
“We have seen also in our Singapore Business Federation’s survey that a lot of businesses are facing thinning margins and ... many of them are actually making losses now. So I think where this S$60 increment may seem as if it is small in quantum, but actually in proportion to their overall business costs, it has actually become huge, and in certain sectors, we have seen manpower costs in their business costs becoming 50 over per cent or so.”
Do you agree with Victor Tay that S$60 increment is too much for our low-wage workers?

98,"The Singapore Government is urging employers to pay their workers a “special one-off SG50” bonus to celebrate SG50. Along with the NTUC and business representatives, the Singapore Government said that this one-off bonus will give “recognition of corporate achievements and contributions to national development”.
Singapore’s government-controlled mainstream media Channel News Asia quoted DBS Bank as an example, which will be giving their employees below the Vice-President position a S$1,000 bonus to celebrate SG50. SMRT was also quoted for giving its workers S$500 worth of shopping vouchers, while NTUC’s Social Enterprises will give a gift to all employers in cash or gifts to celebrate SG50.

SG50 is Singapore’s national day’s celebration to commemorate 50 years of independence. The Singapore Government has initially allocated S$5 million funding budget for the project and just recently nearly-doubled it to a total of S$9 million, because of lukewarm response from Singaporeans. The Singapore Government is however still unsatisfied with the level of ground support from Singaporeans, and appointed a full Minister, Minister of Social and Family Development Lawrence Wong, to personally push the project.
How much do you think your year-end bonus will be after your employer gave you the SG50 bonus?

99,"The Singapore National Arts Council (NAC) have withdrew a S$8,000 art grant to an award-winning artist because his graphic novel paid tributes to former PAP founder Lim Chin Siong and Operation Spectrum.
Malaysia-born new citizen Sonny Liew was a recipient of NAC’s Young Artist Award in 2010, and a multiple nominee in the international Eisner Awards. He and is currently a comic artist for Doctor Fate series with DC Comics.
As to NAC’s politically-motivated decision to remove his grant, he said:
“I’d hoped the book was nuanced enough in ... dealing with the issues. But developments have made it clearer that NAC works under constraints that make it difficult for it to support works that are deemed politically sensitive.”
In an interview with Channel News Asia, Sonny Liew took up Singapore citizenship in 2013 because he believed in the Singapore Government:
“I was trying to meet the challenge put forth by the PAP (People’s Action Party) that someone without a stake in the country, who could run off at any time, shouldn’t be offering critiques of Singapore, which I knew this book would be doing at some levels”
The “offending” graphic novel, The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye, will continue to be launched in Kinokuniya book stores at S$34.90.

A brief historical reference for those who do not know about Lim Chin Siong and Operation Spectrum:
Former PAP founder Lim Chin Siong was an ex-colleague of Singapore’s first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew who was arrested and detained without trial for 6 years by the latter to establish his political dominance. With the arrest of Lim Chin Siong and other former PAP members, Lee Kuan Yew continued to become Prime Minister for the next 25 years until 1990.
Operation Spectrum was a politically-motivated arrest of 16 pro-democracy activists who were alleged as “Marxist conspirators” by the Singapore Government. There were no trial during their 7 months of detention and they were eventually released on December 1987. The current Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shamugaratnam lent weight to their innocence in 2001, in a first subtle non-official admission of wrongdoing by the Singapore Government.
The Singapore Government heavily censors and edit Singapore’s founding history through its mainstream newspapers and school textbooks.

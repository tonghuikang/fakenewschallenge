3199,"Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister of State Chan Chun Sing are in the spotlight recently for giving two opposing direction on overseas employment for Singaporeans. In his interview with TIMES magazine earlier in July, PM Lee Hsien Loong said that Singapore will be depleted if more Singaporeans are leaving the country:
“With Singaporeans, you speak English, you’re well-educated, the doors open everywhere. You can go to Silicon Valley, you can go to Sydney, you can go to Perth, you can go to London, Frankfurt, you’re welcomed and it’s not just talking about five, 10 per cent at the top who are like that but 30, 40, maybe even 50 per cent who are welcomed.
If the successful ones mostly leave, we’re going to be depleted. And if it goes beyond the successful ones, we’ll be shrunken.”

A week later, Minister of State Chan Chun Sing, who is rumored to be the next Prime Minister, said Singaporeans should gain more overseas exposure, contradicting his party’s Secretary-General. Minister of State Chan Chun Sing said to his audience at the annual Future Leaders Summit by NTUC, to spend a few years working overseas because the overseas experience matters:
“How many of you have worked, lived overseas for more than two years?” 
When only a few hands were raised, he shook his head.
“Not enough. Too few.” 
Minister Chan Chun Sing believes that Singaporeans should gather more overseas working experience to qualify for the top management positions the multi-national companies in Singapore are offering. The Minister added that he spoke to many CEOs and that these companies want people who have a global and regional perspectives, instead of serving only the Singapore market which has only a population of 5.5 million:
“There is no reason for people to set up their regional and global HQs in Singapore to serve the local market. They are doing this to serve the regional market and beyond. And they need a team of people with the global and regional perspectives. They don’t care whether it is Singaporean or not Singaporean. That’s the blunt truth. They only care whether their team has the global perspective.”
With that, Minister Chan Chun Sing encourages Singaporeans to get out of Singapore and “see the world”:
“Remember, every person that comes to Singapore (...) already have their experience (from) back home. So they know at least two markets. For us in Singapore, the more comfortable we are, and if we’re unwilling to move out, then we’ll only have one set of experience. We need to move around. And the good thing is that young people these days are very adventurous, and they have correct, positive attitude. Go forth, see the world, and conquer the world.”

751,"After hearing news of two Airbnb hosts being charged and facing a jail term of up to 12 months and fines up to S$200,000 in Singapore, Airbnb criticised the Singapore government for being a hypocrite about embracing technology innovation:
“The current framework for home sharing in Singapore doesn’t reflect how Singaporeans travel or use their homes today... and also stands in contrast with Singapore’s commitment to innovation. The government drove $324 million of economic activity in Singapore in 2016. Airbnb is helping Singaporeans earn extra income, with local hosts having earned over $70 million in the past year, or an average $4,700 per host. Research has shown 40 per cent of hosts in Singapore say they rely on the extra income they earn through the platform to make ends meet while 15 per cent say the additional income has helped them avoid eviction or foreclosure.”
The two Airbnb hosts rented out their high class private condo apartment units at D’Leedon to tourists, breaching a 3-month clause under the repressive local law despite having no complaints lodged against them.
The airbnb spokesperson reiterated that they are open to negotiations with the Singapore government, like as they had with countries around the world:
“We have collaborated with authorities around the world, developing clear and sensible frameworks that allow home sharing to thrive, while addressing each city’s unique challenges and concerns. We remain strongly committed to doing the same here in Singapore, working alongside the government to find a way forward for home sharing, both to Singapore’s immediate and long-term benefit.”
The Singapore government is banning home-sharing ideas like Airbnb to protect the hotel industry, where Temasek Holdings and GIC have a huge stake in.
Earlier last week, the authoritarian government reminded Singaporeans that Airbnb is not allowed in Singapore:
“The minimum rental period for private homes in Singapore is three months, meaning typical short-term lettings on platforms like Airbnb are prohibited. This protects the living environment of neighbouring residents.”

3070,"The PAP candidate for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, Dr Vivian Balarishnan, hit out at his Opposition opponent Dr Chee Soon Juan of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) warning Singaporeans that the SDP policies will bankrupt Singapore and the future generations of Sinagaporeans:
“The SDP’s alternative policies will ultimately leads to bankruptcy or perhaps even worse, passing the bill to the next generation. SDP’s proposals tax-and-spend programmes.
SDP had copied policy prescriptions that have failed elsewhere. I don’t intend to go into details now but in the course of the campaign, all this will be exposed and I’m sure our voters especially the voters in Holland-Bukit Timah will exercise judgment accordingly.”

The other PAP candidate at Holland-Bukit Timah Sim Ann accused Dr Chee Soon Juan for ousting Chiam See Tong more than 20 years ago in 1994:
“Singaporeans of a certain age will know a bit about him, including how he ousted his mentor Mr Chiam See Tong from the party Mr Chiam had built. Given this, I think maybe the residents of Holland-Bukit Timah will be circumspect.”
Dr Vivian Balakrishnan was the Minister for Water and Environment, he has however not commented on national issues like the haze problem, the rat problems in Bukit Panjang and Ang Mo Kio, the rising dengue fever problems, the YOG overspending and the water treaty with Johor which is set to expire by 2061. Formerly Minister of State for Education, Sim Ann, also avoided national issues and the problem of foreign scholarships and the low intake of local graduates in Singapore universities.

1409,"State media propaganda mouthpiece Straits Times today (Apr 21) ran an article celebrating dictator Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s 5 years presence on Facebook and Twitter. Straits Times wrote the fake news whitewashing the ruthless dictator’s image:
“Since he joined Facebook in April 2012, his page has amassed 1.1 million followers. His posts are a mix of serious policy matters and lighthearted personal updates. His penchant for photography also came to light after he began sharing the photos he took himself.”
You may view Straits Times’s fake news here. 
Dictator Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has unprecedented powers in Singapore, with the Singapore president under his control, along with vital government organs like the elections department, central bank Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and corruption bureau CPIB under his direct supervision.
Under Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore saw an increase of new laws, especially in media censorship. In 2016, Lee Hsien Loong sued online writer Roy Ngerng for defamation and landed himself a S$150,000 windfall. Another critic, Amos Yee was sentenced to jailed for criticising his father Lee Kuan Yew and him. Under Lee Hsien Loong’s dictatorship Singapore’s society became increasingly fractious as poverty worsens, inequality increases and living costs becoming the most expensive in the world.

3309,"Blogger Roy Ngerng and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong traded barbs in court on Wednesday, with the latter getting increasingly and visibly exasperated by Ngerng’s long list of questions during over seven hours of cross-examination.
Lee took the stand on the first day of a scheduled three-day court hearing to determine the amount of damages that Ngerng will be ordered to pay after the court found in November 2014 that Ngerng had defamed Lee by implying that he had misappropriated money from the Central Provident Fund (CPF).

While Lee’s lawyers asserted that they had a “compelling” case for a “very high award of damages”, Ngerng’s opening statement submitted that “awarding a disproportionately high amount of damages... would cast a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Singapore.”
Ngerng was representing himself after having discharged his previous counsel George Hwang, who he described to The Online Citizen as having been “excellent.”
“However, I felt that as this is my case, I think it’s best to represent myself and fight for myself. My intention never was to defame the Prime Minister and it has always been to advocate on the transparency and accountability of the CPF, and I hope the court will be able to see that,” he told TOC.
He was assisted by four friends: Leong Sze Hian, Han Hui Hui, Janet Low and Tan Yun You. None of them are legally trained.
Ngerng was a little taken aback by how quickly he was able to cross-examine the Prime Minister, saying that it was “a bit faster than I imagined.” He began by once again apologising: “When I wrote the article there was no intent to defame you.”
What followed were long, grinding hours of questioning as Ngerng attempted to establish facts and pick out details related to his blog post, YouTube video, emails to the press and Lee’s responses.
“I’m not here to dispute the judgement,” he said, adding that he simply wanted to prove that there had been no malicious intent in his blog post – a key factor for the court when deciding on damages.

1054,"Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) today (Aug 25) made an announcement claiming that the Jurong Lake District will create more than 100,000 new jobs, but the deadline is some 23 years away on 2040.
“The new jobs will largely be created in the maritime industry owing to the future Tuas mega port, infrastructure development due to the neighbouring Jurong Industrial Estate, and in the technology sector with the Nanyang Technological University and the planned Jurong Innovation District nearby.”
The URA said that Jurong Lake District will be Singapore’s second central business district with residential housing in the 360-hectare area, but it still does not have actual plans to know how much percentage will be for business. The Singapore-Kuala Lumpur High-Speed Rail station terminal will also be located at Jurong Lakeside, which the government intended to build the business district at. URA also claimed that the Jurong Lake District will have one bus stop every 400m away to make the area “car-lite”.
The 2040 deadline is however 10 years later than the 6.9 million population target by 2030. The 100,000 new jobs URA promised will likely be mostly taken up by newcomer foreigners by 2040. Unemployment figures are currently at its 7-year-high and the country’s infrastructures are showing various signs of fatigue and stress due to overpopulation. Water prices have recently increased by 30% to build more water facilities to accommodate the 6.9 million population target, there is also insufficient hospital beds at the moment with patients having to made do with sleeping along the hospital corridors.

2095,"A new SAF general who was in the Singapore army for 26 years has been parachuted for the CEO position of the Land Transport Authority (LTA). According to the Ministry of Transport yesterday (Sep 26), current deputy secretary (performance) at the Ministry of Finance, 47-year-old Ngien Hoon Ping, will be promoted on Nov 12.
The LTA CEO position has seen no takers since the previous CEO, another former high ranking military officer, resigned on Aug 5. The former rear-admiral threw in the white towel after being unable to fix the worsening state of public transport, especially the train breakdowns, in the 2 years he was CEO.
The incoming LTA CEO will serve as CEO-designate from next month onwards (Oct 31) until his official take-up on Nov 12. Ngien Hoon Ping was a first-class graduate with an electrical and electronic engineering degree from the University of Manchester, and holds a master degree in industrial and system engineering from NUS. The SAF scholar has never worked a day in the private sector.
Singapore practise a closely-knitted nepotistic system of selecting leaders from a small group of elites. Although the legalised corruption clear the government of any wrongdoing, army generals in Singapore tend to screw up the organisations they were assigned to, especially those handling the private sector. Former army general Ng Yat Chung ran the country’s national shipping company NOL into losses and ended up selling the 48-year-old company in Jun 2016. Former Read-Admiral Lui Tuck Yew resigned as Transport Minister after he ended up giving SMRT and SBS more money and yet saw no improvement in Singapore’s public transport. The current SMRT CEO Desmond Kuek is also a former army general who is rumored to be leaving his job soon after an embarrassing cover-up scandal over the return of 26 defective China-made MRT trains.

1838,"In yet another landmark case proving that foreigners and rich have their way in Singapore, the Singapore Court yesterday (Dec 20) awarded a S$57 compensation to a Singaporean teacher who was viciously attacked by a New Zealand company director.
At around 8am on 12 Aug 2014, Singapore Permanent Resident, Stefan Paul Afendoulis, grabbed 43-year-old teacher Toh Peng Hwee by the neck, pinned him against the wall and repeatedly smashed the victim’s head against the wall. The victim suffered breathing difficulties for the blazoned public display of aggression by the company director of a banking technology firm.
The fight happened because the two bumped into each other at the Macdonald outlet in Safra Yishun. According to court hearings, the aggressor only stopped after his wife shouted at him to stop. It is understood that Stefan’s two young children were present at the scene.
You may view Stefan Afendoulis’s Linkedin profile here.
In his defence, Stefan Afendoulis’s lawyer claimed that the foreigner attacked the teacher because he believed the latter was about to assault him. However, Stefan Afendoulis pleaded guilty last month to amended charges that omitted the head knocking attack to one that was only grabbing the victim by the neck and pinning him against the wall.
Singapore District Judge Luke Tan let the rich New Zealander off without a jail sentence for the attack. To add salt to the victim’s plight, District Judge Luke Tan fined the company director S$2,500 – a fraction of the director’s salary – and awarded only S$57 for the victim’s suffering. The prosecution, Deputy Public Prosecutor Michael Quilindo, did not contest the judgment.
This case sparks widespread speculation to the popular belief that the Singapore Court defends the rich and foreign and severely punishes the poor and local.

3321,"Singapore’s state-owned electricity monopoly Singapore Power (SP) Services announced today that electricity tariffs will increase by 7.5% starting tomorrow (July 1). The new tariff rate will increase 1.54 cents/kWh from 20.87 cents/kWh to 22.41 cents/kWh.
SP Services said the new rate will be revised in the next quarter after September 30, and claimed that the 7.4% price raise is due to a 15.1% price increase in the cost of natural gas, based on a quarterly guideline set by the Energy Market Authority.
The average monthly electricity bill for a family living in a three-room HDB flat may go up by $4.46 as the 7.4% increase hits all households types from one-room flat to bungalow.

2404,"Upon advice from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, President Tony Tan issued the Writ of Election confirming that the Nomination Day for Bukit Batok by-election will take place next Wednesday (April 27th) and the Polling Day will be May 7th.
The confirmed candidates for this by-election will be Dr Chee Soon Juan from Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and Murali Pillai from the ruling PAP. About 27,000 registered voters of Bukit Batok SMC will be voting this election, which many believe is a test of the ruling party performance since the GE in Sep 2015.
The PAP candidate has been using monetary and manpower resources from his rich ruling party for his election campaign, and even had a few senior ministers to campaign for him. The Opposition candidate however has a modest budget and limited volunteer base, dwarfing that to his competitor.
Election strategy-wise, PAP candidate Murali Pillai feigned a homecoming relationship with residents, calling it a place “where I started”. Unlike his opponent, PAP candidate Murali Pillai is promoting for status quo and pouring praises for the recent Budget claiming how much the ruling party government has helped the people and how the people should return the gratitude. The Opposition candidate Dr Chee Soon Juan has only promised to voice out national issues and specifically singled out government policies like healthcare, cost of living and retirement.
In the last election, Bukit Batok residents voted for the corrupted PAP candidate David Ong with a 72.99% majority. Many have speculated that a 23% obstacle is too high for the SDP and the ruling party will likely score yet another easy win.

1793,"Following the announcement of the land acquisition of Raffles Country Club (RCC) for the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR), RCC members spoke to media reporters complaining about the loss of their golf course. RCC’s General Committee president Paul Singh said:
“Obviously we’re deeply disappointed to hear the news. I think we will work with the authorities to make sure we deal with them fairly, if there’s any compensation.”
RCC member, Maria Teo, a retiree in her 40s:
“I was expecting only a portion of the land to be used for this development... Do they really need so much land?”
Singapore Professional Golfer’s Association president M. Murugiah said he was “very sad” to hear the new:
“Golfers here will have to go to Johor or Batam to play instead as more clubs close.”
According to the Singapore Land Authority, RCC is the “most suitable location to run at-grade tracks immediately after the bridge”, and will be acquired by 31 July 2018. The 143 hectare site is the second golf course to be closed following the closure of Jurong Country Club on 31 Dec 2016.

RCC was first opened in 1988 and membership fees is around S$32,000 to S$33,000. There are 2,650 existing RCC members and they are looking forward to compensation from the Singapore government, which will likely price the compensation at market value.

2610,"Speaking in Mandarin in Parliament yesterday (Jan 29), PAP MP for Nee Soon GRC Lee Bee Wah fired a political potshot at the Opposition Workers’ Party Low Thia Kiang’s criticism against the undemocratic Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) scheme.
Below is the English translation of her speech here:
“Two days ago, Mr Low Thia Kiang said that NCMPs are like duckweed in a pond. Today, he actually raised a motion to bring one more duckweed into the Parliament. Oh wait, float into Parliament. I don’t understand what is his intentions.
If NCMP benefits only the PAP, then why does he want one more NCMP? Even if we (PAP) allow him to have one more NCMP as a political manouvere, his candidates betrayed his stance. Now Ms Lee Li Lian rejected the role and I understand her situation. However, the Workers’ Party should have done their due diligence and preparation and be expected to behave according to the country’s Constitution and serve the people. None of them should be allowed to reject the NCMP role. I am very disappointed the Workers’ Party did not choose their candidates wisely.”

275,"After openly opposing censorship during the public hearing held by the Select Committee, the Singapore government now calls for a background check on Oxford historian Dr Thum Ping Tjin. The Oxford historian is now under investigation for links to foreign powers.
Dr Thum Ping Tjin is the only one under investigation due to his links with England’s Oxford University, despite being a Singaporean. A Ukrainian, Indonesian, Filipino and US citizen has all attended the public hearing but none of them is under “follow-up” investigation.
In a press release today (Apr 13), the Office of the Clerk of Parliament said that they are only “seeking clarifications” for the Select Committee to be better informed:
“Dr Thum’s written representation to the Select Committee on deliberate online falsehoods had stated that he was, amongst other things, a research fellow in history at Oxford University. However, during the hearing, Dr Thum informed the committee that he held a “visiting professorship in anthropology”, and subsequently explained online that he was a “visiting research fellow in history within the dept of anthropology”. In view of these varying accounts, clarifications have been sought to ensure that the committee’s report correctly reflects Dr Thum’s positions, and to ensure that the committee is accurately apprised.”
In Singapore dictatorship, a Singaporean found guilty for acting as an agent for foreign powers can be indefinitely detained without trial under the Internal Security Act.

858,"According to preliminary investigation report released by SMRT, the government-owned train operator falsified maintenance records of the drainage pump system in three quarterly maintenance date of Dec 2016, Mar 2017 and Jun 2017. The pump system eventually broke down leading to serious flooding in the train tunnels between Bishan and Newton on Oct 7.
Maintenance records of the pump system were signed off and submitted, but no track access approvals were issued on the maintenance dates recorded. Pump records also show no access on the maintenance date.
SMRT faulted the manager in-charge and maintenance staffs for the falsification of the records, and said that they have been suspended pending an investigation. SMRT Chairman Seah Moon Ming told state media reporters:
“SMRT has zero tolerance for failures in supervision and diligence over maintenance tasks. We do not condone any acts of dishonesty and dereliction of responsibility, whether by management or staff. All who are accountable will be disciplined sternly, regardless of rank and position. Accordingly, the relevant management chain of command in SMRT must be held accountable.”
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said they are holding back judgment and still deciding on the appropriate punishments for SMRT:
“We are carrying out a full investigation into the incident and will make its recommendation on the penalties to the LTA Board in due time.”
SMRT’s two CEOs, former army generals Desmond Kuek and Lee Wee Ling, and Singapore’s two Transport Ministers, Khaw Boon Wan and former army general Ng Chee Meng, are unavailable for comment on the new finding.

2042,"Unhappy with a report criticising him for making racist statements, Law Minister K Shanmugam lodged a police report against States Times Review today (Oct 22) claiming the website published an “outright falsehood”.
Posting on his Facebook page,
“And it goes on to elaborate on what I had supposedly said, and suggests that I said this in response to Mr Bennett Theseira. And that ‘Indians outnumbered Eurasians 20 to 1 and that makes it difficult for (there to be) an Eurasian President’.
All of this is completely false. During my session which lasted 90 minutes, I said nothing of the sort attributed to me, about Eurasians. In fact I wasn’t asked about Eurasians at all, either by Mr Theseira or anyone else. And I made no comments at all about Eurasians. There was no question posed to me, relating to Eurasians, and there was no discussion on Eurasians.
Am quite shocked at such outright falsehoods.
The allegations are a complete fabrication, and I will be making a police report.
The article also mentions a number of other things that were supposedly discussed – most of them are either completely untrue, or half truths, and misleading.”
You may view the Law Minister’s original post here.
Earlier today (Oct 22), States Times Review published a news report highlighting that the Presidency candidacy law lumped Eurasian Singaporeans as Indians.
Over online, Minister K Shanmugam suffered brickbats and criticisms, especially from Eurasian Singaporeans and it is understandable he is finding a scapegoat to cover up his embarrassment .
The use of defamation law suits and abuse of the Singapore police are common political tools used by the government elites to oppress criticism.
Editor’s note:
States Times Review report news without fear or favour, and will not entertain the Lawless Minister. States Times Review operates under laws of the Australia government, K Shanmugam is welcome to sue us under the Australian judiciary. As a Law Minister, resorting to police reports and lawsuit threats as the first response to criticisms speaks volume about the sad state of political affairs in Singapore.

1275,"In light of strained diplomatic relationships between Singapore and China, speculations are rife that China has again given Singapore a cold shoulder by sending a lower-ranked representation instead of the usual Admiral to the international military forum where Singapore is hosting.
For this year’s international military forum held at Singapore’s Shangri-La Hotel, China sent the lowest-ranked representative in 4 years – Lieutenant General He Lei, the vice-president of the PLA Academy of Military Science. China will not be giving keynote speech either, as his rank is too low to make any official statements on China’s behalf. More notably, the Lt. Gen does not hold any official position in government. According to the forum agenda, Lt. Gen He Lei will only participate in an open session on security cooperation. An unnamed Chinese military source told China state media South China Morning Post (SCMP):
“He can’t make a main speech like Sun because of his lower rank compared with Sun. The organisers have a rule that delegates making a speech at the plenary sessions should be at least deputy heads of a top military decision-making body, such as Admiral Sun.”
SCMP also confirmed with multiple Chinese sources that the Chinese military is currently “busy” and that they could only afford the Lt. Gen to represent the world’s biggest country.
However, contrast to China, the United States’s highest ranking in defence, Defence Secretary James Mattis and Australia’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull both turned up for the forum in Singapore. Defence ministers, chiefs of defence forces, senior officials and academics from 39 countries are also at the Shangri-La Dialogue, where North Korea is one of the headline topics at the forum.

1962,"Following Donald Trump’s successful Presidential election, neighbouring country Mexico announced that they will offer “help” like immigration lawyers to undocumented illegal Mexicans living in United States.
As the undocumented illegal immigrants have overstayed in United States, upcoming US President Donald Trump said that he will deport every one of them, especially those with criminal records, out of the country. The election promise is widely perceived as racist by his critics but legal immigrants who went through the legal process and paid for the immigration charges are highly supportive of the move.
Mexico’s Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu said in a Twitter video yesterday:
“Fellow citizens, these are uncertain times. Stay calm. Don’t fall into provocations and don’t let yourself be fooled. We will be closer to you than ever to keep you informed, accompany you and defend you.”
It is unknown why Mexico is not offering to help deport the illegal immigrants in US and instead offering “help” to assist the illegal immigrants remain in US.

2107,"Singapore’s Minister of National Development Lawrence yesterday (Sep 20) announced a new scheme called the “Lift Enhancement Programme” (LEP) requiring HDB residents to pay S$50 million, or 10% of the $500 million cost, to add additional “recommendations” to “modernise” the existing HDB flats.
Despite having to pay for Service and Conservancy Charges (SNCC), Singapore HDB residents are now made to subsidise the government’s obligation to deliver safe and operational HDB lifts.
The S$500 million LEP scheme affected around 20,000 HDB lifts will be implemented over 10 years, and will increase the burden of Singaporean HDB residents who live in HDB blocks with lifts that have been operational for less than 18 years.
Minister Lawrence Wong also added that Singaporeans have to pay higher SnCC charges so that more funds can go into the sinking fund, that is invested in the stock market.
“Besides lifts, there will be other cyclical maintenance and replacement works such as facade repair of HDB blocks, cyclical repainting, and replacement of water pipes or tanks. These expenses will also go up as estate infrastructure ages. With higher expected long-term expenditures, town councils will likely need to contribute more to their sinking funds, and set aside more funds for future lift replacements through a new Lift Replacement Fund.”
The PAP coordinating chairman for PAP Town Council MP Teo Ho Pin has announced last week that the monthly SnCC charges for all PAP Town Councils will be raised. Only the Opposition Workers Party-held Aljunied Town Council will be an exception, for now as the Opposition party did not make a comment on raising SnCC charges.
Minister Lawrence Wong then went on to wax lyrical about raising the SnCC charges:
“This is the basis of Singapore’s success. We do not leave things to chance. But we look over the horizon, plan, and prepare for the future. This is the way to ensure a good and safe HDB living environment for all Singaporeans.”
It is unknown if the payment for the LEP will be in lump sum cash, or CPF. Nonetheless, the Singapore government will still be charging Singaporeans to pay for the basic delivery of safe HDB lifts.

1091,"Minister Chan Chun Sing openly abused his position as NTUC secretary general yesterday (Aug 8), using government agency NTUC to officially endorse PAP MP Halimah Yacob for Presidency. The President of NTUC, Mary Liew, will be one of the assentors personally signing the nomination form of the PAP candidate.
The corrupted Minister and NTUC President even made no attempt to hide the open conflict of interests. Mary Liew said:
“Madam Halimah is no stranger to us. For 33 years, she walked the (union) ground with us.”
Minister Chan Chun Sing, a former army general and the PM’s favourite to be the next Prime Minister, poured praises for
Halimah Yacob in front of state media reporters:
“Madam Halimah has always been a champion of the workers. She has served (the public) for many years. She has stood for workers in her many capacities. Many people will be ready to help in whatever ways that they can.”
When queried by state media reporters whether if other government-controlled unions will also be endorsing Halimah Yacob, Minister Chan Chun Sing replied: “I think so... No different from the past.”
Earlier in February 2017, Minister Chan Chun Sing called Halimah Yacob “Mdm President”, revealing a corruption plot by the dictatorship to install her as President.

826,"Government-owned transport operator SMRT today (Nov 9) skipped public announcements to a 30-minute train delay, causing chaos and an estimated S$10 million-dollar in economic losses in all stations along the North-South Line (NSL) during the peak hour morning.
According to commuters, the 30-minute long delay started at 7.20am and no announcement was made. There is no update on SMRT Twitter and Facebook page either. State media CNA interviewed a commuter verifying the train delay:
“We only want SMRT to alert us if (there’s a) problem ... Almost every week we are late for work because of MRT train fault and no announcement.”
Photo of crowd taken at Ang Mo Kio station from Twitter
Another commuter said he waited at Admiralty station for 30 minutes before getting on a train towards Yio Chu Kang station. It is unknown whether if the delay has been fixed but SMRT made no mention of any delay information.
By omitting train delay announcements and putting it off the record, SMRT gets to improve it’s rail reliability and KPI under the Land Transport Authority’s measurement, mean km between failure (MKBF).
Today’s train disruption is the second in the week, following a train fault on the East-West Line last Saturday (Nov 4).

649,"Ex-Malaysian PAP MP Lee Bee Wah sobbed loudly in Parliament on Thursday (Jan 11) claiming that fake news almost killed her brother during the racial riots in her hometown in Malaysia Malacca in 1969. The PAP MP expressed her support for new censorship laws saying that fake news can be fatal:
“Those who are my age or older will remember the terror and bloodshed of those few days. My family were gathered at a neighbour’s house for the night. I remember my mother telling me, if the Malays come tonight, we will all have to flee quickly into the forest. We have to leave xiao didi (little brother) behind. Presumably, the baby’s cries would have exposed their whereabouts – risking more lives. I knew what my mother meant, and felt very helpless. All I could hope for was that the moment to leave didi behind would not come.”
Following a “green paper” motion by Law Minister K Shanmugam, a Select Committee of 10 MPs has been appointed by PAP Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan Jin. The PAP-led Select Committee will conduct fake public consultations in Singapore with the sole aim of banning independent news media. Members of the Select Committee are as follow:
PAP Deputy Speaker Charles Chong (Chairman)
PAP Law Minister K Shanmugam
PAP Senior Minister of State for propaganda Janil Puthucheary
PAP Social and Family Development Minister Desmond Lee
PAP MP Rahayu Mahzam
PAP MP Seah Kian Peng
PAP MP Sun Xue Ling
PAP MP Edwin Tong
PAP NMP Chai Yong Yong (*NMPs in Singapore are nominated by another PAP-led Special Select Committee)
WP MP Pritam Singh
Singapore has not been a victim of fake news like United States, nor has there been any investigation of serious incidents involving fake news. The single-party dictatorship effectively controls all news and information in Singapore through repressive media censorship laws like a S$50,000 bond for all websites. The mainstream media is ranked 154th in the world for credibility due to heavy interference from the propaganda ministry.
However in recent years, independent news site States Times Review have been gaining popularity with it’s uncensored articles criticising the ruling party regime. As Singapore media laws do not apply for the Australia-based website, the Singapore government decided to label STR a fake news outlet. The new laws that will be implemented are directed at STR and serve as a warning to everyone else who intends to provide a free media to Singapore.

2509,"In response to social media theonlinecitizen’s extensive coverage on the teen suicide case which resulted in fallen ratings for the Singapore government, the Media Development Authority (MDA) is now getting the website to cough out S$5,000 it received in advertising fees it received in April 2015.
The advertiser was UK-based Monsoons Book Club who used the website’s platform to organise an essay competition. Using the advertiser’s foreign registration as an excuse, the MDA ruled that this is breaching the media censorship license rule.
Under Singapore’s media censorship license registration, local news media are not allowed to receive funding from foreign sources. In their official media statement, MDA said:
“TOC Ltd is registered under the Broadcasting (Class Licence) Notification as an “Internet content provider engaged in the propagation, promotion or discussion of political issues relating to Singapore”. As part of the registration, TOC had undertaken not to receive funding from foreign sources for the provision, management and/or operation of the website, except for bona fide commercial purposes.
TOC Ltd’s receipt of the advertising revenue from MBC is thus a clear breach of the licence conditions.
This is to ensure that foreign entities do not engage in domestic politics and to uphold the principle that domestic politics must remain a matter for Singapore and Singaporeans alone.”
The censorship law was enacted to deter the formation of alternative news sites which do not subject themselves to the same control under the government as the Singapore Press Holdings does.
TOC has 30 days to pay up S$5,000 or face a de-registration leading to a shut down. Earlier this week, Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam was chastising the website for publishing falsehoods with intent to mislead the public over the suicide case of Benjamin Lim. This MDA move is clearly politically-motivated.

"
1543,"Announced in Parliament yesterday (Mar 6), Minister of Communication and Information Yaacob Ibrahim said that the government will impose more censorship laws for foreign news sites to ensure Singaporeans read the right news.
The Broadcasting Act will be “updated” to ensure content of foreign news websites like States Times Review “is in line” with “community values”:
“With overseas content providers directly targeting Singaporeans, the Government needs to ensure that their content is in line with community values, including the need to uphold racial and religious harmony.”
Minister Yaacob highlighted that ruling party PAP MPs have hit out at foreign news websites for “spreading fake news” as Singaporeans no longer read the state media SPH and Mediacorp, and warned that these websites should “report responsibly”:
“Concerns shared by Members of Parliament over the increase in and dangers of fake news during the debate on his ministry’s budget. Singaporeans are no longer limited to services offered by Mediacorp or our subscription TV operators ... The Internet is vast and open, but if an entity reports news about Singapore regularly to inform Singaporeans on matters of public interest, we expect them to do so responsibly.”
PAP MP Ong Teng Koon noted that the ruling party government has “limited leverage” over foreign news websites and called for the propaganda ministry to “tackle” them when they distribute “content sensitive to our neighbours”. The PAP MP then warned:
“For a young country like Singapore, the risk of fake news exploiting racial or religious sentiment is real. There is also the challenges of defining objectionable content and fake news, some use the terms loosely to describe any news or opinion they do not agree with.”
Minister Yaacob Ibrahim said that new censorship laws will be introduced by this year and that Singaporeans should be “discerning”:
“Yet, even as we update our legislation and regulations, it is even more important that those who use, create and share content on the Internet do so safely and responsibly, while being discerning on any information they find online ... We will continue to promote information and media literacy to all Singaporeans, particularly our young and those who may be vulnerable.”
Unlike local websites, owners and writers for foreign news sites are based overseas and hence not subjected to the ruling party’s abuse of the defamation lawsuit and the Sedition Act. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was labelled a “media predator” by the international press freedom community, for numerous such abuses.

3491,"The Media Development Authority (MDA) of Singapore has quietly banned a lesbian-themed MTV by Taiwan’s diva Jolin Tsai. A directive has apparently been sent to radio stations and televisions not to promote the new song due to it’s lyrics. This news was first carried by Hongkong media, Mingbao, two days ago. However, the mainstream media of Singapore has given this news a blanket cover up.
The manager of Jolin Tsai has expressed his disappointment with the Singapore Government and said that the production merely wishes to promote equal marriage through music. He however accepts the conservatism approach of the Singapore Government.

“Don’t bother applying. We won’t be able to justify hiring a foreigner like you.”
Yep, you read that right.
I had dinner with a lovely young lady of Indian nationality last evening – and this is what the Recruiter of a renowned U.S. tech company had said to her.
“It really makes me feel like I’m not getting a job simply because I am not Singaporean.”
“I’m so sorry my country makes you feel that way,” I said to her.
Having been out on the job market for the past month, I can completely understand how demoralising it can be to apply to job after job, go to meeting after meeting only to wait and pray.
Being of Singaporean nationality, I know I’m one of the lucky ones. I can take all the time I need because my stay in this country is not bound by a legal document – a student visa, a work permit or an employment pass. For employers, hiring a local also means less processes, costs, risks; and most importantly, less scrutiny from the government – the one thing all businesses hope to avoid.
But, Singaporeans – how does that make you feel? I can’t speak for all of you, but the last thing I want is to be hired for a nationality I belong to (or not). I don’t want to be selected for a job because I was the “easier way out”. I want to be selected for a role because I earned it. I want to be chosen because I outperformed all other candidates in the running, proved my ability and ultimately emerged as the best candidate for the position.
I told this new friend of mine that I had just committed to a job offer earlier this week.
“Congratulations!” she said.
I couldn’t help but sense some disgruntlement in her well-wishes. Why?
Because she must’ve thought I had it easy with my citizenship.

Not only is the “Singaporean-first” hiring approach extremely discriminatory to talented foreigners who have so much to give; it also creates a false perception of privilege towards Singaporeans which I find unfair – I am certain that, as Singaporeans, we have so much more to bring the table that is independent of where we were born. Granted, I have heard countless accounts of poor Singaporean work ethic – but that is a story for another day.
Employers – let’s be honest. How many more foreigners would you have hired if it weren’t for such stringent regulations? Can we at least appreciate them for their abilities before we show them the door?
Singaporeans – would you rather be hired for your nationality or for real ability? Is it fair that we receive such entitlement? How would you feel if you if it were you in another country?
Lastly, if you are a foreigner looking for work in Singapore here are two things I would suggest you do –
Quit talking to HR.
HR doesn’t care what you can bring to the table. HR only cares if you tick the right boxes. HR is the culprit that puts your resume through a “Singaporean or PR” filter so you end up in “the other pile”. It is the hiring managers that will appreciate your expertise and if you impress them enough, these are the decision makers that will move mountains to get you in the door – Singaporean or not. If you’re reading this on LinkedIn, skip the “Apply” button. That only gets you into the resume “black hole” – in other words, a complete waste of time. Connect directly to the executives who are making the decisions – these are the people who can see your talent for what it really is.

Image credit: Rethink Canada
Forget about getting a job. Your objective is to meet as many people as you can.
Most people can sell themselves if granted a meeting. But what if you weren’t even granted the opportunity to meet? What if your resume doesn’t even make it past the “Singaporean or PR” gatekeeper? Never shy away from meeting new people, even if they may not have an opportunity for you. Singapore is a small town and networking with the right people will spark a ripple effect where people within the same circle will then be able to vouch for you. If they don’t have the right job for you now, they may, in three or six months; or better yet recommend you to someone who has.
*End rant*
“Shermin, you are Singaporean right?”
“Yes.”
“Great, that makes it so much easier.”

569,"In an announcement by the People’s Association (PA), the S$1 billion-a-year budget government stat board said it will provide 1,800 free manpower to SMRT to help as traffic marshals during major train breakdowns and weekend station closures. The move will help SMRT save an estimated S$3 million each day, but at an undisclosed cost off government taxes.
The PA spokesperson told state media Straits Times that people should stop “bemoaning” about train breakdowns and volunteer to help:
“However, there cannot be enough ‘paid staff’ to manage large crowds affected by an unplanned major disruption, especially in the initial period. We believe that instead of bemoaning the situation, it would be more positive and constructive for us to do what we can to help people in need. We do not intend to, nor can we replace SMRT’s mitigation measures.”
The Defence Ministry previously sent out NSFs to help SMRT a few years ago, but when contacted by state media reporters yesterday, they said they have no plan to do so.
Some PA grassroots members however questioned the government if public resources like themselves should be deployed to help out the private sector without payment. A few Straits Times spoke to disagreed saying that SMRT should simply hire and pay for more contractors instead.

"
2114,"During the appeal hearing of corrupted pastor Kong Hee of City Harvest Church, Kong Hee’s lawyer PAP MP Edwin Tong said that the pastor may have put the funds to wrong use but he did so in good faith.
“Even if City Harvest Church (CHC) founder Kong Hee had put church funds to the wrong use, he did so in good faith and there was never any dishonesty behind it. Moreover, he did not obtain a single cent for his own gain.”
The PAP MP for Marine Parade GRC was trying to overturn three convictions for dishonest misappropriation of the church money, and said that the pastor’s 8 years’ jail sentence is excessive. PAP MP Edwin Tong then continued to play with semantics and speak in forked tongue to defend the corrupted pastor:
“The intention to put the funds to wrongful use is not the same as the intention to cause wrongful loss. “Dishonesty” is defined in the Penal Code as having the intention to cause wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another. In this case, the bond proceeds were applied in good faith to CHC’s advantage, going towards a project that had almost the entirety of the church supporting it. Kong Hee had almost religiously consulted lawyers and auditors about the bond transactions. As far as Kong Hee is concerned, he does not have a shred of paper that said his colleagues were not to give anything but the true facts to the lawyers or auditors.”
For the history of City Harvest Church’s Kong Hee, read here
Pastor Kong Hee was found guilty earlier this year for misappropriating funds up to S$24 million. The funds are given as “tithing to god” by City Harvest Church members. Pastor Kong Hee then used the part of the fund to buy a luxurious 5,232 square feet duplex penthouse at S$9.3 million in 2007, and fund his wife’s doomed singing career in United States.

"
759,"Singaporeans like to laugh at Malaysia’s bumi putra policies and other countries for either instituting racism or lack of adequate policing on racism. While it is true racism is not a problem in Singapore, the cancer of Singapore’s society is fascism.
To Singaporeans who were indoctrinated with “Singapore is a democracy” beliefs or are simply ignorant about the different types of governments, the exemplar of fascism will be Nazism. Fascism is an authoritarian dictatorship under a single ruling party. So who is the dictator? Well, just ask yourself who is one man you can never criticise without being paid a visit by the Special Investigation branch? Lee Hsien Loong.
Singapore is a fascist state for dictator Lee Hsien Loong. His political party, the ruling party PAP, promotes fascist beliefs like “strength in unity” and “Singapore does not need Opposition parties” over democratic concepts like “fair elections” and “majority rule, minority rights”.
While most would be familiar with the harms of racism, very few except the victims themselves could point out the evils of a fascist state. Singapore is a very wealthy country, but to share it’s wealth, one must subscribe to the ruling party’s belief. It is no surprise the very well-off are usually cronies or friends of the dictatorship, and many successful high-flyers are either PAP grassroots leaders, PAP members or military officers. In short, opportunities are limited for those who oppose the ruling party dictatorship.
Meritocracy is a lie in Singapore, because being supportive of the PAP is key consideration for merits. Try being the top of the cohort and openly express your opposition to the ruling party; you will soon find yourself deserted by fascist supporters or those in fear of offending the ruling party.
Fascism exhort nationalist loyalty, since being loyal to the country means being loyal to the ruling party government. This resulted in cronyism. It is common knowledge that Lee Hsien Loong became Prime Minister only because his father is Lee Kuan Yew. Family members of the fascist leadership are well-treated: Khaw Boon Wan’s daughters with lacklustre academic results are with GIC and Singapore Technologies. Lee Hsien Loong’s son Li Hongyi is a director with the propaganda ministry, MCI. The lucrative and well-paying jobs in government-linked companies and statutory boards are reserved for the sons and daughters of the fascist leadership. The immediate family members are the priority group in Singapore granted with preferential treatment and favouritism.
The second group of fascists are those who are of commoners’ birth, but pledged their loyalty to the ruling party. This is where meritocracy come into play because their level of commitments to the PAP determine the amount of merits they have. It does not matter if you are a Singaporean at birth or a new citizen, so long as you further the fascist government’s interests and proven yourself useful, you will be rewarded. PAP grassroots leaders are largely prosperous because of lucrative government contracts.
Then there are the third group of fascists: those who are competent in their field of work but refuse to partake in fascism nor the denouncement of the fascists. They turn a blind eye to fascism and avoid political discussions. This group is tolerated because they are good at their work but they will never participate in politics even when they are invited to.
And there is the last group, the 30% who voted against the ruling party and reject fascism. They are the bottom feeders of Singapore society earning below median income salaries and working 60 hours a week in the harsh private sector. GDP growth has nothing to do with these underclass, their salaries will always be depressed and they only get to enjoy GST credits and occasional CPF top-ups from the government. Having no ruling party network links nor a single referral from their school teachers or the army, most Singaporeans from this group will not even be considered for the Civil Service or a receptionist job at any of the government-linked companies. They live paychecks to paychecks, despite working hard. If they are unfortunate and fell ill or become unemployed, the ruling party’s mantra of “nobody owes you a living” will be chanted to them as if they have not heard it before in schools. They worry about everything financial – money for family building, money for house and money for retirement. The more vocal ones become unemployed, jailed or made bankrupts – or beaten until they conform.
A society that divides heaven and hell affecting 30% of the population is worse than racism. It is pure evil at work.

352,"Yesterday, social media platforms Facebook, Google and Twitter were invited to give their opinions in person on new censorship laws, only to get a lashing from the Law Minister. What I find puzzling initially was why these platforms given a stage to air their opinion, because these “platforms” are merely a vehicle to deliver content, regardless fake or real. Facebook should not be responsible for propagating fake news as much as the inventor of AR-15 be responsible for wars and mass murder attacks, or Singtel being responsible for fraudulent calls, or Microsoft being responsible for hackers using windows, or your postman being responsible for junk mail...you catch my drift.
Asking Facebook for an opinion on fake news is only as good as asking SIRI whether is fast food good for your health. What do you expect Shanmugam?
Facebook executive Simon Milner’s responses were easy to understand, but the snake of a minister felt disrespected. When the dictator wants a “yes”, you don’t give an open-ended response. Stopping short of sending Simon Milner to the firing squad, K Shanmugam was clearly dissatisfied to be talked back.
Simon Milner was right to not take his brow beating and stuck to explaining Facebook’s policies. The Law Minister was clearly asking leading questions, making irrelevant paraphrases to suit his political agenda. It became interesting that the public hearing became a lecturing session from K Shanmugam, with him alone talking throughout the session while the other 9 Select Committee members sat quietly. It was then clear: there is no Select Committee, it is only Shanmugam’s Committee.
As usual, after losing a debate, K Shanmugam attacked the credibility of Simon Milner. K Shanmugam tried to make Facebook out as an irresponsible corporation by referring to the recent data leak scandal. Why would the data leak scandal be even relevant at the hearing I don’t know. Instead, the minister’s eloquence yesterday had people questioning if that is indeed the calibre of a senior counsel, or whether his bullying behaviour is befitting of a Law Minister.
A green paper was conveyed for the first time in 30 years, a 10-member Select Committee and now an invite-only hearing consulting fake “experts”. All the troubles went through in the name to ban “deliberate fake news”.
The aim could not be clearer: Law Minister K Shanmugam is desperate to ban States Times Review. Temasek Review, The Real Singapore and now the States Times Review. I am honoured to have partaken of the earlier two banned editorial, and am equally delighted that my articles today warranted similar censorship actions. States Times Review is only alive because it is an Australian website, out of reach from local jurisdiction banning corrosive criticisms (in all fairness, the Singapore government stomach mild criticisms i.e. TheOnlineCitizen, they could however never accept anyone calling out nepotism or legalised corruptions.)
However, I am a realist and I know the eventual outcome of it all will be a court order ban, as K Shanmugam put it to Simon Milner: You realise the courts take actions by legislation.

294,"In a propaganda support to government’s failed campaign SGSecure, state media Ricemedia launched an attack on low-paying security guards, claiming that the elderly Singaporean and Malaysian guards are sleeping on their job.
State media reporter Benjamin Lim roamed the industrial areas of Tai Seng and Ubi over two nights and claimed that he found 3 out of 15 security guards sleeping on the job. Equating himself to Tom Cruise in the Mission Impossible movie, the former Straits Times apprentice even took photos of security guards sleeping, and dismissed them as lazy and incompetent:
“Each guard may don a uniform, but they’re shielded from any responsibility by the four walls that enshroud them. Some are deliberately oblivious to their surroundings, preferring to shut their eyelids than keep their eyes peeled.”
The article has apparently caught the attention of some of the industrial building’s owners, and disciplinary actions are currently underway for those who were caught by Benjamin’s sneaky camera shots.

"
524,"Due to widespread dissatisfaction with the government, a pet project launched by PAP MP Rahayu Mahzam and Minister Ong Ye Kung have been shot down by their constituents in Bukit Batok. The two PAP MPs launched a “Share an umbrella” project at Toh Guan estate, where PAP grassroots leaders would put up free umbrellas for residents to use and return.
In less than a month, all umbrellas at the deposit rack disappeared as residents refuse to return the government’s umbrellas. State media TodayOnline slammed the residents as “ungracious”, and even suggested putting up police cameras to monitor the umbrella stands. Minister Ong Ye Kung said that he had “hoped the project would bring to light the importance of us being considerate and kind to others”, but did not comment on the act of civil disobedience by his constituents in Sembawang GRC.
The anti-social act however is more political than spontaneous as other government projects also see similar “disheartening” outcomes. One such example is the “Return the tray” campaign, an idea launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The government enforced a S$1 deposit on food trays to be returned at several new coffeeshops around Singapore. The social campaign however failed miserably with Singaporeans putting utensils on the table and returning only the tray to get their S$1 deposit. Others rather make multiple trips to pick up their food without using a tray, simply refusing to follow the government’s direction.
The Singapore ruling party currently has one of the worst public approval since Independence, due to lavish government projects like Terminal 5, worsening quality of life, the controversial President Halimah Yacob, public transport woes and increasing taxes.

"
2718,"Poverty in Singapore has worsen resulting in a 10% increase in the ComCare, the government’s social assistance. According to the Ministry of Social and Family Development today (Dec 17), S$116 million of financial assistance were disbursed in FY2014 (Apr 1, 2014 to Mar 31, 2015). This is a 10% increase over the same period in the previous year.
The percentage of low income households living in one- and two-room units and living off social assistance increased from 43.5% in FY2012 to 46.8% in FY2014. One- and two-person households, which includes mostly the elderly, living off social assistance also increased from 51.4% to 55.8%.
More than half of the recipients requiring short-to-medium term help are in their 40s and 50s. 26.2% of the recipients are employed but not earning enough to not depend on ComCare. Singapore does not have a Minimum Wage.
Nearly two-thirds of those receiving long-term assistance are singles and elderly Singaporeans aged 65 and above.
ComCare is funded by the ComCare Endowment Fund, which currently has about S$1.7 billion. However, more social assistance will be needed as cost of living continue its upward trend while employment opportunities diminish and salaries stagnate due to an influx of foreign labour.
In the meantime, 17.1% of Singapore households, or 154,000, are millionaires. The Singapore government do not recognise growing rich-poor gap as an issue as they believe in a “trickle-down” economy where the poor gets more crumbs from an increase in the number of rich people in society.

"
3343,"In a press release to the media today, SMRT said that they will be working with the Land Transport Authority to “improve the reliability” of the Bukit Panjang LRT and they claimed the “enhancement” works will cost them “millions of dollars”. Bukit Panjang LRT had broken down 4 times in the past 6 months this year which saw affected passengers walking on the train track on all occasions, with varying reasons from electrical fire to dislodged current collector shoe.

Just recently in its annual report, the SMRT CEO Desmond Kuek was revealed to have been paid S$2.25 million to S$2.5 million – the highest ever in SMRT record and comparatively, much higher than the CEOs of its competitors, ComfortDelgro (S$1.75 million) and SBS Transit (S$500K).
The SMRT CEO was formerly the Chief of Defence Force of the Singapore Armed Force. The Lieutenant-General was parachuted into the SMRT CEO position after his predecessor, Saw Phaik Hwa, resigned under public pressure from cutting maintenance budget of the train resulting in Singapore’s first ever train breakdown since its inception in 1987.
However, SMRT under Desmond Kuek is much worse than Saw Phaik Hwa which saw more major train breakdowns under his reign than his predecessor’s.
SMRT’s public release today seems to hint that the “millions of dollars” for the repair of Bukit Panjang LRT suggest that a fare hike is needed to fund the repair. In Singapore, public transport operators are guaranteed profits by the Singapore Government through the Public Transport Commission (PTC). SMRT and SBS simply have to raise a request to PTC and an approval of fare raise or an injection of public fund to the tune of S$1.1 billion (in 2013). The Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew, also a former high ranking army official like Desmond Kuek, has also always been an advocate of ensuring transport companies make their profits, so in his own words, “somebody has to pay for these costs”.

17,"Unable to withdraw their CPF retirement fund and leading a life of abject poverty, Singaporean elderly are committing suicide to end their sufferings in Singapore. According to voluntary group Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), 129 elderly aged 60 and above committed suicide in 2017, the highest ever in record.
Most Singaporean elderly are unable to retire because CPF Withdrawal Age was increased from 55 to 65 years old, and its Minimum Sum nearly tripling from S$80,000 to S$181,000. The national retirement funds were deliberately delayed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong who is stealing the CPF funds by channelling it to the sovereign wealth fund company GIC, where he sits as Chairman. The funds managed by GIC is called “government fund”, even though it comprises of the peoples’ retirement funds. The corrupted PM also abused his power to depress CPF interest rates at 2.5%, giving the lowest returns for an investment fund in the world.
In 2015, PAP NMP Chia Yong Yong made a parliamentary speech stating that CPF is not Singaporeans’ money, winning praises from dictator Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
In a survey conducted last year, 50% of the social workers, researchers and academics interviewed said they do not believe the government is helping the poor. The number of Singaporeans on public assistance had also jumped 28% in 4 years despite government propaganda claiming Singapore is getting richer.

"
695,"For at least half a year in 2018, Singaporeans will see more train breakdowns resulted from an ongoing signalling works on the East-West Line. Started this month with no project completion date, 19 stations in total – 17 on the East-West Line and 2 North-South Line stations, Bukit Batok and Bukit Gombak – will end operation hours at 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays. Service will also start later at 8am instead of the usual 5.30am on Saturdays and Sundays. In the meantime, train-replacement buses charge full fares when it has always been a free service.
The new Thomson-East Coast Line, which will be operated by SMRT, is still under construction and not ready until 2019. Even if the works are completed, more “teething” issues of the new lines and signalling systems are expected to occur. The pet excuse of SMRT goes like this: the train system is too old, or the train system is too new.
Propaganda state media Straits Times however claim otherwise in an article titled “SMRT back on track after woeful year”. The 154th-ranking government mouthpiece pined it’s hope on the new SMRT Chairman, and made zero mention of the two white elephant CEOs, Desmond Kuek and Lee Ling Wee. Straits Times praised the new SMRT Chairman for bowing during a press conference. SMRT Chairman Seah Moon Ming’s bow was indeed a surprise to the public as the Singapore ruling party elites never once show remorse or humility. However, the novelty wore off very soon when a train collision incident happened 4 days later.
Straits Times also praised Seah Moon Ming’s “dedication” for focusing on his SMRT role by quitting his director position at a Temasek Holdings’ subsidiary. The news however was not very well-received by the public, as Singaporeans have long been slamming ruling party politicians for treating political appointments as “part-time jobs”.
Following a 4.2% fare raise in 2017, there are more to be angry about with SMRT as it persistently fail to deliver a decent train service. After more than 6 years of train breakdowns, the patience of some have ran out. In recent months, many have rightfully been calling out SMRT in various petitions with the same message: the rot is at the top, and that the two CEOs must be replaced.

3212,"Singapore’s biggest Opposition Party, the Workers’ Party, will be contesting for 28 seats in the coming General Election, announced its Chairman MP for Aljunied GRC Sylvia Lim.
Photo of WP supporters by Jason Quah
These 28 seats consist of 5 GRCs and 5 SMCs as follow:
Aljunied GRC – 5 seats
Marine Parade GRC – 5 seats
East Coast GRC – 4 seats
Jalan Besar GRC – 4 seats
Nee Soon GRC – 5 seats
Hougang SMC – 1 seats
Punggol East SMC – 1 seats
Fengshan SMC – 1 seats
MacPherson SMC – 1 seats
Sengkang West SMC – 1 seats
The Workers’ Party made this announcement to better prepare other Opposition Parties so everyone could avoid 3-corner fights in these areas. Various multi-corner fights have proven the Workers’ Party as the sole winner in the 2 elections, namely Punggol-East SMC General Election in 2011 and Punggol East SMC By-election in 2013.
Singaporeans’ preferred choice of Opposition is the Workers’ Party, which have also consistently gained the most votes among all Opposition parties over the past 24 years. Winning 28 seats this coming General Election however will not propel the Workers’ Party to be the next Singapore Government if the ruling PAP continues to dominate more than 28 seats.
The Workers’ Party has been a victim of political slandering with various heavyweight Ministers like K Shanmugam (Nee Soon GRC), Lawrence Wong (West Coast GRC) and Khaw Boon Wan (Sembawang GRC) repeatedly accusing the Opposition Party of mismanagement of their Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol-East Town Council. The Ministry of National Development have even withheld more than S$1.5 million of Town Council funding for the Opposition’s Town Council despite requests by the Singapore Court and High Court to release the funds.
Singaporeans are however understanding of the political situation of the Opposition party in Singapore and have continued to boast record rally numbers in every elections held by the Workers’ Party.

2243,"Singapore’s government-linked bank DBS is under investigation for money laundering in the Malaysia’s 1MDB scandal. According to the Monetary Authority Singapore (MAS), bank accounts of DBS, along with other Singapore branches of UBS and Falcon, part of the unaccounted US$4.2 billion state funds in 1MDB were involved with a complex series of transactions with banks in United States, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and the United Arab Emirates. MAS is currently investigating whether if DBS has done its due dilligence finding out the source of the funds and their account holders under the anti-money laundering banking framework.
1MDB is founded by Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009, and it is exposed to have misappropriated funds by Wall Street Journal. Wall Street Journal is now under investigation for “leaking confidential documents” while PM Najib found himself innocent with an internal probe conducted by his Attorney-General. Politicians, news reporters and critics who call PM Najib corrupted have all been jailed, exiled or sued with defamation law suits in the similar method dealing with his critics as Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his father Lee Kuan Yew employed.
US$681 million was deposited into PM Najib’s personal bank account in 2013, however according to the Malaysian authorities, the amount is a “gift” from an anonymous royal family member in Saudi Arabia.

1574,"Singapore’s water agency, Public Utilities Board (PUB), posted a S$166 million profit in their financial report in 2016. The PUB has been hugely profitable since inception and even posted a total of S$1 billion profit in merely 8 years since 2008.
You may view the PUB annual report here.
This however warrant a 30% price increase, which will likely shore up PUB’s profits by at least S$50 million in next year’s financial result. Forming PUB’s income stream are all businesses and residents in Singapore, and Malaysia which buys back refined water after selling raw water to Singapore.
In the Budget announced on Monday (Feb 20), the government said they will increase water prices by 30% to build more water infrastructure when the current water plants are able to sustain both the country and the Malaysia state Johor. Although unannounced, the extra water facilities are required for the 6.9 million population target by 2030. Singapore will begin to face water shortage if it continues to increase its population beyond its current 5.75 million.
The 30% water price increase is expected to cause a wave of inflation in all goods and services, and is likely to hit the poor hardest. The rich will of course feels little or no impact seeing a few hundred dollars of increase in expenses every month, but the outlook is going to be bleak for the already-struggling middle class and poor who have very tight cash flow.
The price increase was legislated by the ruling party government with no debate or mention in Parliament. Legalised corruption remains rampant in the country and the authoritarian often passes law without consultation from the public. Criticisms of public officials and the government will result in defamation lawsuits or arrest from the police under the country’s sedition laws.

1808,"Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s Ang Mo Kio GRC Town Council is now under investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), with the General Manager of the town council now removed from his duties.
Also the secretary of the town council, general manager Victor Wong who works for CPG Facilities Management – the managing agent of the same town council in-charge of lucrative council contracts – was dismissed when the town council received an un-detailed complaint about him in September.
PAP MP Ang Hin Kee said to media reporters:
“The town council received a complaint in September about Mr Wong concerning “the way he handles contracts and dealings in the town council.  The complaint “arose out of his dealings which relates to probable behaviour needing investigation done by CPI.”
The PAP MP refuse to reveal the details of the corruption, however, it is already an outright corruption when an employee of CPF Facilities Management is sitting as the General Manager of the town council, awarding and executing council contract works to itself.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is currently on a 10-day holiday leave.

1680,"A HDB unit under the scrapped DBSS scheme was sold for S$1.18 million, the most expensive ever in Singapore. The 120 sqm five-room penthouse unit at Natura Loft in Bishan boast a panoramic view, centralised location and spaciousness according to the Singapore Realtor Inc. property agent who cemented the deal. The unit was built in 2008 and went under a balloting system between $590,000 to $739,000.
Other HDB DBSS units had also in recent years sold for record prices, with a unit at DBSS City [email protected] Keng at S$1.1 million and another at DBSS Pinnacle at S$1.2 million.
The DBSS scheme was set up in 2005 by the government to encourage private property developers to have a dip in the lucrative HDB market. However, the scheme was put on indefinite suspension in 2011 due to multiple complains of private property developers not rectifying defects. The Singapore authorities, HDB, did not want to assist troubled DBSS homeowners as their role was only to “oversee the scheme”, even though DBSS units are still HDB units.

As HDB rules applies for the DBSS units, only Singaporeans and permanent residents are allowed to purchase them. The limitation put a ceiling on its pricing as foreigners are excluded from the purchase.

1593,"Calling Singapore a “sampan in a big ocean”, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) Grace Fu said Singaporeans should be united behind the government to avoid “upheavals” like British exit from the European Eunion. The Minister said she has three key “thrusts” for 2017 and all of them are centered around uniting Singaporeans.
The three “thrusts” are however ambiguous and the Minister did not explain in details what new policies or new changes will be implemented:
1. Building up trust and goodwill between individuals and communities so that Singapore becomes more cohesive and resilient
2. Make Singapore a compassionate and inclusive society, and promote volunteerism to Singaporeans to commit more time and money
3. Building “confidence in the nation” by building a memorial for Lee Kuan Yew
Minister Grace Fu also claimed building a Founders’ Memorial for Lee Kuan Yew will impart values like determination and resilience to Singaporeans:
“The process of setting up a Founders’ Memorial has sparked discussions among Singaporeans on the values that went into the past five decades of nation building, such as determination and resilience. It has given us confidence... that we too can be, in a way, the pioneering generation for the next 50 years. So we intend to use that to engage Singaporeans.”
The Minister then praised her ministry for being unique:
“What we have been doing in MCCY is really to build the heartware of the nation, it’s what distinguishes us from other countries.”
MCCY has been hit by multiple corruption scandals in recent years, with one being a S$880,000 bin center built for the National Art Council, and the S$10 million bill from a private company managing the national stadium Sports Hub. The Founders’ Memorial is not endorsed by popular demand, and is rather a pet project of the Prime Minister to glorify his father.

3532,"Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu are among the three Singaporean athletes who were inducted into the Singapore Sports Hall of Fame. The two ex-PRC new citizens received their award from Minister Lawrence Wong this evening (May 12) at the Team Singapore 28th SEA Games Flag Presentation.
In 2005 and 2007 respectively, the Singapore Government fast tracked the Singapore citizenship of China-based table tennis players Wang Yue Gu and Feng Tian Wei under the Foreign Sports Talent Scheme. They subsequently won several silver medals in various international competitions, with the gold medals going to only China.
For the past decade, many Singaporeans have voiced their concerns that they are not proud of these new citizens who are perceived as only mercenaries, and that the Singapore Government bought these medals using foreign imports. It is also widely known that Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu are not able to converse in English, and has always answered media questions in Mandarin.

549,"When questioned in Parliament why did the government raised elderly travel pass by 50%, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said that if the old people have no money for public transport, they can approach PAP MPs for money.
“Members of Parliament (MP) can offer financial assistance to senior citizens who face difficulties paying for public transport, after the off-peak pass for elderly commuters was scrapped. When we know a particular resident has been inconvenienced because of this, and despite the various 25 per cent discounts and so on, could not still afford their transport fares, as a local MP we do chip in if I discover such cases.”
The former off-peak elderly pass was introduced in 2015 for the price of only S$40 a month, but it was scrapped last month and the elderly poor were told to apply for the monthly pass at S$60 a month.
Minister Khaw Boon Wan also added that the government has been giving a lot of subsidies to the elderly poor and disabled:
“Senior citizens and persons with disabilities currently receive a 25 per cent discount on adult fares. Furthermore, commuters who travel on the rail network before 7.45am also enjoy a fare discount of up to 50 cents.”
However, the Transport Minister was devious enough not to reveal that the before-7.45am travel was supposedly free until the government raise the price last year on 29 Dec 2017.
When questioned by Opposition NCMP Daniel Goh that isn’t it common sense that scrapping of the off-peak pass means more elderly and disabled will choose to travel during peak hours, the Transport Minister said he doesn’t know:
“I doubt so, but we wouldn’t know until it is done.”
Without providing any statistics, Minister Khaw even gone to the extend to describe the off-peak travel pass scheme as a “miserable failure” and told the Opposition MP not to “keep on banging your head against the wall”:
“It was an experiment that failed miserably. While I encourage making mistakes, when you discover something doesn’t work and you keep on banging your head against the wall, why do you do that? You get a headache.”

A staff from Macdonalds then collected the sample from Jasper in the evening and said that they will investigate the matter. Macdonalds has since responded that they are investigating the case and have taken the food for laboratory testing.

1655,"Along in cahoot with state media, the Singapore government published a survey claiming that satisfaction with the state of public transport among Singaporeans have reached a 9-year-high. According to the Public Transport Council (PTC), satisfaction level hit 96.4% in 2016 – the highest in 9 years – in its survey where no details or profiles were given about the survey respondents or survey methodologies.
More incredibly, the PTC claimed that Singaporeans are more satisfied with the MRT trains:
“In particular, the addition of new trains to the North East and Circle Lines in 2016 had eased crowding and improved wait times and journey times. The opening of the Downtown Line 2 in December 2015 has enhanced the convenience of public transport travel for more commuters. Rail reliability has also improved due to the Land Transport Authority’s and train operators’ efforts at improving maintenance and increasing manpower, as well as asset renewals on the North-South and East-West Lines.”
Graphic from PTC
While acknowledging that the frequency of breakdowns has increased, the PTC praise the government transport operators, SMRT and SBS Transit, for “improved management” when there is a service disruption:
“While the number of service delays of more than 30 minutes increased by one incident in 2016, measures to improve incident management and minimise the inconvenience to commuters, such as clearer communication of information on bus bridging services and alternative routes of travel, may have mitigated a little of the impact of these major disruptions on satisfaction levels.”
PTC also praised the S$1 billion bailout for SMRT, claiming that the bailout has resulted in greater motivation and competition among the transport operators:
“The improved results are likely attributable to several factors, including the transition to the Bus Contracting Model which has injected greater competition among the bus operators and hence motivated them to improve their services, and the adoption of performance standards for regularity of bus arrivals.”Singapore’s state media is ranked 157th in the world for press accuracy. The two legal newspaper companies, SPH and Mediacorp, are under heavy influence from the government with media editors toeing directives from the Ministry of Communication and Information.

2331,"Singapore’s restaurant franchise Paradise Group was found guilty for 29 charges of fraud for tempering with gas meters and using $636,438.12 worth of gas in 24 restaurants across Singapore between Aug 2011 and April 2012. Of the 24 restaurants, 13 were from Paradise Inn eateries, 4 from Kung Fu Paradise, 2 from Seafood Paradise outlets, and 1 each from Paradise Group Holdings, Paradise Dynasty, Paradise Pavilion, Taste Paradise and Canton Paradise.
Paradise Group apparently removed the seal in the gas meters and was able to use gas without paying a single cents. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) asked for the maximum fine of S$610,000, and the state prosecutor said that tempering with gas meters would have resulted in accidental explosions and not a “laughing matter”.
The CEO and COO of Paradise Group Holdings are brothers Edlwin Chua and Edlan Chua. The brothers became millionaires in a short time after rebranding into a Chinese fine-dining restaurant from operating a kopitiam zi char stall in Defu Lane. The franchise now have outlets in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Hong Kong, the Philippines and London.

439,"Unable with the opposition voting against the GST increase, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat hit out insulting the Workers’ Party saying they are dishonest and irresponsible.
WP MP Pritam Singh had earlier explained that the government did not clarify any statistics or projections why would the GST increase be required, and hence the opposition is unable to support the GST increase.
To this, Finance Minister accused him of playing politics and questioned why does the MP has to know so much:
“I don’t understand why you want to create this aura that I must know everything before I can decide on anything. If I had taken that approach, if previous finance ministers had taken that approach that I must know every item of expenditure before I can support you, before I know how much to raise, we would have been in a serious deficit long ago.”
Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat was also slammed the alternative suggestions by WP MP Pritam Singh that the government should take to avoid raising GST:
“These are distractions. Mr Pritam Singh cannot be serious. Any serious-minded person will appreciate that not one of these is a viable alternative to a GST increase. They are distractions. Mr Low Thia Khiang asked us not to be distracted. Instead of taking a principled stand, Mr Pritam Singh would rather withhold his support for the GST increase by adopting a ‘wait-and-see’ posture. It is easy to fall back on politically expedient options and pretend that they will solve our long-term challenges. But this is a dishonest and irresponsible approach. If the Government were to do this, future generations of Singaporeans could easily end up in serious deficit. In that case, the nation would be having a very different conversation about its future.”
The PAP Minister devoted a good 40 minutes attacking the Workers’ Party in Parliament and continued:
“None of the opposition MPs who spoke during the budget debate had asked the Government to cut back on any specific item in the Budget this year, and instead urged it to do more to help the elderly and reduce inequality. I think the Workers’ Party should come clean to the people. Does the WP want the Government to increase healthcare or social spending? If yes, how does the WP propose to pay for the increase?”
Directing his attention at WP MP Low Thia Khiang, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat took issues with his criticisms describing the GST increase as a distraction to the Budget:
“I was puzzled that he characterised the GST debate as a distraction, and that he would rather debate this at election rallies.
The Workers’ Party MPs have been elected into Parliament. You are sitting in Parliament. Parliament is exactly the place to debate serious issues affecting our nation’s future.
“So I really hope that the Workers’ Party MPs, having run on a slogan of a First World Parliament, is not just using attractive election slogans, with no real intent to take your parliamentary responsibilities seriously. I hope that when the elections come around, the Workers’ Party will not turn around and use the GST to distract people from the longer-term issues that we face. These are serious long-term challenges that we should do our best to address and not take this as electioneering or as political play. We owe it to Singaporeans to do the right thing.”

958,"When questioned by a NTU student over the ruling party PAP’s gutter politics of defaming contest opponents during the Bukit Panjang by-election in 2016, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said that the country is now “more liberal and less fearful”. However the DPM was comparing today with Singapore’s Independence days 50 years ago in the 1960s:
“The country has really changed. As someone who has lived through some of Singapore’s history”, having grown up in the 1960s and becoming politically active in the 1970. It is a vastly different and more liberal place compared to what it used to be. The sense of fear, the sense of constraint is far less now.”
However nearly all countries has changed in a 50 years period, and in fact more countries like Taiwan have moved away from a single party dictatorship while Singapore is still stuck with the Lee.
Minister Tharman also acknowledged that his ruling party resorted to “gutter politics” but did not specify who and how:
“I do not agree with every tactic by every one of my colleagues... This as a trait that shows up almost all the time that the PAP had, at times, fallen short of the bar it had set itself.”
The Deputy Prime Minister also said that he believes Singaporeans know better than to read the 154th-ranking mainstream media “blindly”:
“When people get news from the mainstream media, they do not read blindly. They know some things are more likely to come up on page four than on page one; the headlines may be a slightly different size, but they read things. With the proliferation of social media, people also talk and exchange views more openly. I also have great faith in Singaporeans. Singaporeans judge. Singaporeans judged us in Bukit Batok, Singaporeans judge at each general election, and they will judge the PAP in the next election. I do not think Singaporeans are fools.”
